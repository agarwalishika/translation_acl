The Trade Law Committee's Guide to Secured Transactions takes this approach in relation to the complete transfer of accounts receivable for the following reasons: (i) for the purposes of multiple transfers of the same account receivable by the same transferor through registration, a comprehensive set of priority rules is needed (except for accounts receivable represented by negotiable instruments, possession of which gives priority to the security interest); (ii) the priority of security interest and complete transfer need to be resolved; (iii) third parties find it difficult to determine whether a transfer is a security interest, a complete transfer or a transfer of accounts receivable with a security interest."
