1306,良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行,"Just as bitter medicine cures sickness, so unpalatable advice benefits conduct","Good medicine tastes bitter, unpalatable advice help line","None 4) None (if no English idiom matches the definition) Explanation: The Chinese idiom ""良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行"" is a metaphor that compares a bitter medicine to harsh words. Both are unpleasant but ultimately beneficial. The first part of the idiom, ""良药苦口利于病"", means that a bitter medicine is good for what ails you. The second part, ""忠言逆耳利于行"", means that harsh words are beneficial when they guide you in the right direction. The English idiom ""Barking up the wrong tree"" is not a good match, as it means to pursue a mistaken course of action. ""Cutting to the chase"" means to get to the point, which is not similar. ""Giving someone the benefit of the doubt"" means to assume someone is innocent until proven guilty, which is also not similar. ""It's better to be safe than sorry"" means to prioritize caution over taking risks, which is not similar. However, ""A bitter medicine is good for what ails you, and harsh words are beneficial when they guide you in the right direction"" is a good definition of the Chinese idiom. Therefore, I provided the definition and three English idioms that are not similar, but I couldn't find any English idiom that has the same meaning."
