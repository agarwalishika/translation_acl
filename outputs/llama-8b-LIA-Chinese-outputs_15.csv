This idiom captures the essence of transformation and renewal, which is central to the Chinese idiom.  The other options, while related to change, do not fully convey the idea of transformation and renewal that is at the heart of the Chinese idiom.  Therefore, ""A clean slate"" is the most fitting English idiom to match the definition of ""秋风扫落叶"".  I hope it is correct.  Thank you for your time.  Best regards, [Your Name]  I am happy to help.
