The phrase ""Living in a bubble"" suggests that someone is isolated from the outside world and has a limited perspective, which is similar to the idea of sitting in a well and looking at the sky, unable to see the world beyond.  The other two idioms, ""Out of touch"" and ""Stuck in the mud"", do not convey the same sense of isolation and limited perspective as ""Living in a bubble"".
