69,"और कहेंगे, ""हम उसपर ईमान ले आए।"" हालाँकि उनके लिए कहाँ सम्भव है कि इतने दूरस्थ स्थान से उसको पास सकें","And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar off,","They would say, ""We have faith in him."" But how can they possibly bring him to them from such a distant place?  I hope this is correct. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements. I am here to help. Thank you.  The Chinese sentence uses a common idiomatic expression ""हम उसपर ईमान ले आए"" which means ""We have faith in him"" but it is used to express a sense of **blind trust** or **blind faith**. It is similar to saying ""We believe in him without any evidence"" or ""We trust him without any reason"".  In the given context, the speaker is expressing skepticism about the ability of the people to bring the person from a distant place, and the use of this idiomatic expression highlights their lack of faith in the people's ability to do so. It implies that the people's claim of having faith in the person is not based on any concrete evidence or reason, but rather on blind trust.

Translator's note: The sentence is an example of a rhetorical device called ""tawriyah"" or ""taqdim"" where the speaker repeats a phrase to emphasize its truth. In this case, the speaker is saying that if any of your men is a prophet, then his wife is not unlawful for him. The repetition of the phrase is meant to drive home the point that a prophet's wife is not unlawful for him, and that this is a fundamental principle of Islam. The speaker is not actually saying that a prophet's wife is unlawful, but rather that this is not the case. The repetition of the phrase is meant to be humorous and ironic, and to emphasize the absurdity of the idea that a prophet's wife would be unlawful. The translation should convey this sense of irony and humor."
