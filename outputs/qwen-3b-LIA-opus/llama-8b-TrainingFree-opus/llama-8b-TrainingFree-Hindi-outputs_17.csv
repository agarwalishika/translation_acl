The idiom suggests that one should be cautious not to speak or act on things one does not truly understand. It emphasizes the importance of humility and self-awareness in one's pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. The idiom is often translated as ""Those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know."" However, the literal translation provided above is more accurate and nuanced, highlighting the repetitive structure and emphasis on the negative aspects of speaking and knowing. This idiom is often used to caution against the dangers of dogmatic thinking, intellectual arrogance, and the spread of misinformation.

In everyday conversation, the idiom can be used to express skepticism or doubt about someone's claims or opinions, or to encourage others to be more mindful and cautious in their words and actions.
