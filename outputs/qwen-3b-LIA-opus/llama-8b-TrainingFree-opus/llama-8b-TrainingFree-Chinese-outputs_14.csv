Word-by-word gloss: bu4 shi4 ni3 qu4 xi3 shou3 ting1 de shi4 hou4 fa1 sheng1 de shi4 er2  (It's not when you go to the bathroom that this thing happens.)  Explanation: This sentence is an idiomatic expression in Chinese. It is used to indicate that a particular event or situation is not a coincidence, but rather a deliberate act. The speaker is suggesting that the person being addressed is responsible for the situation, implying that they may have intentionally caused it to happen. The sentence is often used in a humorous or ironic tone to imply that someone is trying to shift the blame or avoid responsibility.  Example: A: 我的手机丢了。 B: 不是你去洗手间的时候发生的事儿。 (A: My phone is lost. B: It's not something that happens when you go to the bathroom.)  In this example, B is implying that A may have intentionally lost their phone, rather than it being an accident. The sentence is used to convey a sense of sarcasm and to imply that A is trying to shift the blame.  Note: The sentence is often used in a humorous or ironic tone, and the speaker is not necessarily suggesting that the person is guilty of anything. It's a way of poking fun at the situation and implying that the person is trying to avoid responsibility.
