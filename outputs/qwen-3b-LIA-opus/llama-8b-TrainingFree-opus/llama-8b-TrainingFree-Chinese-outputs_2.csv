Chinese translation: 福鲁卡瓦没有说明他回到科威特后合同方面的状况。  Explanation: The Chinese translation is a direct translation of the English sentence. However, the original English sentence conveys a subtle nuance that the Chinese translation misses. The word ""after"" in the English sentence implies a sense of ""delay"" or ""postponement"", suggesting that Furukawa's return to Kuwait was somehow delayed or postponed, and that's why the contract situation was not explained. The Chinese translation does not convey this sense of delay or postponement. A more idiomatic translation would be: 福鲁卡瓦没有说明他回到科威特后合同方面的状况。 (Furukawa did not explain the contract situation after he returned to Kuwait, implying that there was a delay or postponement in his return.)  Cultural note: In Chinese culture, the concept of ""after"" or ""postponement"" is not as explicitly stated as in English. The Chinese translation relies on the context and the reader's understanding to infer the sense of delay or postponement.  Idiomatic note: The Chinese translation uses the phrase ""合同方面的状况"" (contract situation) to convey a sense of ""what happened"" or ""what's going on"", which is more idiomatic and natural in Chinese. The English translation uses the phrase ""what happened to the contract"", which is a more literal translation.  Overall, the Chinese translation aims to convey the same meaning as the original English sentence, but with a more idiomatic and culturally sensitive tone.  Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything!  If you want me to explain the Chinese sentence in a more concise way, here is a revised version: Sentence: Furukawa没有说明它返回科威特以后合同方面出现了哪些情况。 English translation: Furukawa did not explain what happened to the contract after he returned to Kuwait. Chinese translation: 福鲁卡瓦没有说明他回到科威特后合同状况。 Explanation: The Chinese translation is a concise version of the original English sentence.
