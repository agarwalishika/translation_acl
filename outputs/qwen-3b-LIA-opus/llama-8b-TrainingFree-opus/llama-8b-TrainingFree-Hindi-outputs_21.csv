( literal translation ) Answer: I have recorded the command key , my authority has turned over this ship to my control now. ( literal translation ) Explanation: This Hindi idiom is used to describe a situation where someone has gained complete control over a situation or a project, often after a period of struggle or uncertainty.

The literal translation of the sentence is: ""I have recorded the command key, my authority has turned over this ship to my control now."" The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation where someone has finally gained control, often after a long and difficult process. For example: ""मैंने दर्ज किया कमांड कुंजी , अपने अधिकार पलट है इस जहाज को अपने नियंत्रण में अब है"" (Maine darj kiya command key, apne adhikar palat hai is jahaaz ko apne niyantaran mein ab hai) - ""I have recorded the command key, my authority has turned over this ship to my control now."" ( literal translation ) This idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation where someone has finally gained control, often after a long and difficult process.
