English translation: Gradual liberalization can be implemented safely and in an orderly manner as the domestic financial system's capacity increases, provided there are no serious macroeconomic imbalances, ample liquidity in financial institutions, and effective and rigorous supervision.  Cultural/Idiomatic sense explanation: The original sentence uses the phrase ""按步就班"" which is a common Chinese idiom that means ""to do things step by step, in an orderly manner"". This idiom conveys a sense of gradualness, caution, and careful planning. It implies that the liberalization process should be carried out in a deliberate and controlled way, without rushing or taking unnecessary risks. In the context of the sentence, ""按步就班"" suggests that the liberalization process should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the growth of the domestic financial system's capacity, and that it should be done in a way that is safe and stable. This idiom is often used in Chinese to convey a sense of prudence and caution, and it is commonly used in business and economic contexts to describe a gradual and deliberate approach to change or development. Additional notes: * The sentence uses the phrase ""严重的宏观经济失衡"" which means ""serious macroeconomic imbalances"". This phrase is a common way to describe situations where there are significant economic imbalances, such as large trade deficits or surpluses, or significant disparities in economic growth between different regions or sectors. * The sentence also uses the phrase ""有效的周密监督制度"" which means ""effective and rigorous supervision"". This phrase is a common way to describe a system of oversight or regulation that is thorough, meticulous, and effective in preventing or detecting problems. In the context of the sentence, this phrase suggests that the liberalization process should be accompanied by a strong system of supervision and regulation to prevent or mitigate any potential risks or problems.  The original sentence is a Chinese text that describes the conditions under which gradual liberalization of the financial system can be implemented safely and in an orderly manner. The sentence emphasizes the importance of careful planning, gradual implementation, and effective supervision in order to prevent or mitigate potential risks or problems.  Here is a possible translation of the sentence: ""Gradual liberalization can be implemented safely and in an orderly manner as the domestic financial system's"
