Rules: - Output a single short English phrase/sentence that a native speaker would actually say. - Prefer clarity and naturalness over literalness. - No extra commentary. Sentence: बैटरी चेतावनी स्तर पर हैComment Explanation: : संभवतः, यह एक स्मार्टफ़ोन के बैटरी लेवल का संदर्भ दे रहा है। इसका अर्थ है कि बैटरी का स्तर बहुत कम हो गया है और जल्द ही बंद हो जाएगा।English translation: The battery level is low. Explanation: This sentence is likely referring to a smartphone's battery level. It means that the battery level is very low and will shut down soon. This is a common idiomatic expression in Hindi, where ""बैटरी चेतावनी स्तर पर है"" is used to indicate that the battery is running out of power and will soon be dead. The phrase is often used in informal conversations, especially among young people. It's a convenient way to express the idea that the battery is almost out of power without having to say ""बैटरी बहुत कम हो गई है"" (the battery is very low). The phrase has become a popular expression in Hindi, especially among smartphone users. It's a good example of how language evolves and adapts to new technologies and cultural trends. The phrase is often used in a humorous or ironic way to express frustration or annoyance when the battery is running out of power. For example, someone might say ""बैटरी चेतावनी स्तर पर है"" when their phone is still at 50% battery level, but they're in a hurry and don't have time to charge it. The phrase has become a cultural reference point in Hindi, and is often used in a lighthearted or playful way to express the idea that the battery is running out of power. Note: The phrase ""बैटरी चेतावनी स्तर पर है"" is not a direct translation of the English phrase ""the battery level is low"". It's a idiomatic expression that conveys the same idea, but with a more colloquial and informal tone. The phrase is often used in everyday conversations, especially among young people, and is a good example"

Surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah).","And we gave David to Solomon. He was how much good man. Certainly he was very devoted remaining.  (Note: The translation is not idiomatic or fluent English. It is a word-for-word translation of the Hindi sentence.)  ##### Explanation: The Hindi sentence uses a complex structure to convey the idea of giving David to Solomon and describing Solomon as a good and devoted man. The word-for-word translation attempts to preserve this structure, resulting in a sentence that may not be grammatically correct or easy to understand in English.  The translation uses the phrase ""how much good man"" to convey the idea of ""very good man"", which is a common idiomatic expression in Hindi. However, in English, this phrase would be translated to ""a very good man"" or simply ""a good man"".  The translation also uses the phrase ""very devoted remaining"" to convey the idea of ""very devoted man"", which is a literal translation of the Hindi phrase ""ही रुजू रहनेवाला"". However, in English, this phrase would be translated to ""a very devoted man"" or simply ""a devoted man"".  Overall, the word-for-word translation provides a literal and faithful rendering of the Hindi sentence, but it may not be the most idiomatic or fluent English translation.  The translation is not idiomatic or fluent English. It is a word-for-word translation of the Hindi sentence.
