331,और वह राक्षस से जुड़ा हुआ।,And linked to that monster.,"He's tied to the demon. Answer: He's tied to the demon. Explanation: The word ""राक्षस"" (demon) is used to describe a deep emotional connection, not a literal connection to a supernatural being. The phrase ""और वह राक्षस से जुड़ा हुआ"" means that the person has a deep emotional connection to their darker side or their inner demons. This connection can be a source of strength, but also a source of weakness. The phrase is often used to describe someone who is struggling with their own personal demons, such as addiction, mental health issues, or past traumas. In this sense, the phrase is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a metaphor for the complex and often tumultuous relationship between a person and their inner self. The English translation ""He's tied to the demon"" captures this sense of a deep emotional connection, rather than a literal connection to a supernatural being. The phrase is often used in a more poetic or figurative sense, to describe someone who is struggling with their own personal demons. In this sense, the phrase is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a metaphor for the complex and often tumultuous relationship between a person and their inner self.
