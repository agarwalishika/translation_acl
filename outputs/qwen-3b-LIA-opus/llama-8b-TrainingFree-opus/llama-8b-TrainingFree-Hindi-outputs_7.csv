The idiom is not a direct translation, but it conveys the same meaning as the original sentence.  The idiom is likely used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is not actually frightening, but is perceived as being so by the person using the idiom.  The idiom is a good example of how language can be used to create a humorous or ironic effect.

Literal translation: Their situation is like that of people who have already tasted the punishment of their work and for them the painful punishment is that they are waiting to taste the punishment of their work.
