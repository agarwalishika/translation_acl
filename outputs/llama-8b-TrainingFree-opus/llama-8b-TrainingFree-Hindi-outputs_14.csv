190,"""... और अब हम दास नहीं हैं ...""","""...and we are slaves no longer...""","We are no longer slaves."" (English) Explanation: The idiom is a quote from a famous Hindi movie ""Lagaan"" (2001) directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The movie is a sports drama set in the 19th century in India during the British colonial rule. The idiom is spoken by the main character Bhuvan (played by Aamir Khan) in a pivotal scene where he addresses the villagers, urging them to stand up against the British colonial rule and assert their independence. The idiom is a powerful expression of freedom and empowerment, highlighting the struggle of the Indian people against colonialism and oppression. In this context, the idiom conveys the idea that the people are no longer bound by the shackles of slavery and are now free to make their own choices and decisions. The idiom has since become a popular phrase in Indian culture, symbolizing the spirit of freedom and resistance against oppression. (Note: The idiom is not a direct translation of the English phrase, but rather a quote from the movie that conveys a similar meaning.) मैंने एक दिन के लिए एक विशेष कार्यक्रम के लिए एक स्क्रीनिंग के लिए एक फिल्म देखी। फिल्म का नाम था ""लागान"" और यह एक 19वीं शताब्दी के भारत में स्थित था। फिल्म का निर्देशक अशुतोष गोवारिकर थे और मुख्य पात्र भुवन (आमिर खान द्वारा अभिनीत) थे। फिल्म में एक महत्वपूर्ण दृश्य है जहां भुवन ग्रामीणों को संबोधित करता है, उन्हें ब्रिटिश शासन के खिलाफ खड़े होने और अपनी स्वतंत्रता का दावा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करता है। इस दृश्य में भुवन द्वारा बोली गई एक पंक्ति है: ""... और अब हम दास नहीं हैं ..."" यह पंक्ति एक शक्तिशाली अभिव्यक्ति है जो स्वतंत्रता और स्वाभिमान को दर्शाती है, और यह भारतीय संस्क"
