Example: - Friend: ""Hey, want to go out tonight?"" - You: ""我们今晚呆在这"" (wǒmen jīn wǎn dāi zài zhè) = ""We're staying in tonight.""  In this context, ""呆在"" (dāi zài) is a verb that means ""stay"" or ""remain,"" and ""这"" (zhè) is a pronoun that refers to the current location or situation.  The phrase ""今晚呆在这"" (jīn wǎn dāi zài zhè) is a fixed expression that means ""stay in tonight"" or ""stay home tonight.""  It's a common way to decline an invitation to go out and stay home instead.  The translation ""We tonight stay in this"" is a literal word-by-word translation of the idiom, but it may not be the most natural or idiomatic way to express the idea in English.  A more natural translation might be ""We're staying in tonight"" or ""We're staying home tonight.""  However, the word-by-word translation is still useful for understanding the individual components of the idiom and how they contribute to its meaning.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""今晚呆在这"" (jīn wǎn dāi zài zhè) also carries a sense of informality and casualness, which is typical of spoken language in Chinese.  It's a common way to communicate with friends or family members in an informal setting, and it's often used in everyday conversations.  The idiom is also useful for expressing a sense of reluctance or hesitation, as in ""我们今晚呆在这"" (wǒmen jīn wǎn dāi zài zhè) = ""We're staying in tonight"" ("

English translation: It is not a transitional government, nor is it related to any person associated with a transitional government.  Idiomatic explanation: This sentence is saying that the current government is not a temporary or intermediate government, nor is it connected to any person who is associated with a temporary or intermediate government. The word ""过渡期"" (transitional period) is a common idiomatic expression in Chinese, implying a temporary or intermediate state. The sentence is emphasizing that the current government is not a temporary or intermediate entity, but a stable and permanent one.  Cultural note: In Chinese culture, the concept of ""过渡期"" (transitional period) is often associated with a sense of impermanence and instability. This is because the Chinese word for ""transitional"" (过渡) implies a sense of movement or transition from one state to another, rather than a fixed or permanent state. Therefore, when the sentence says that the current government is not a transitional government, it is emphasizing that it is a stable and permanent entity, rather than a temporary or intermediate one.  Example use case: This sentence could be used in a speech or article to emphasize the stability and permanence of the current government, and to reassure the public that it is not a temporary or intermediate entity. For example: ""我们要强调的是，当前的政府不是过渡期国民政府或与过渡期国民政府有关的任何人做的。它是稳固的，永久的，能够带领我们走向更美好的未来。"" (We want to emphasize that the current government is not a transitional government, nor is it related to any person associated with a transitional government. It is stable, permanent, and can lead us towards a brighter future.)  This sentence would be used to reassure the public that the current government is not a temporary or intermediate entity, but a stable and permanent one that can provide leadership and stability.  Note: The sentence is written in a formal and official tone, which is typical of Chinese government statements and official documents. The language is concise and direct, with no unnecessary words or phrases. The sentence is also written in a way that is easy to understand, with a clear and logical structure.  Additional cultural note: In Chinese culture, the concept of ""过渡期"" (transitional period) is often associated with a sense of uncertainty and instability. This is because"
