It is used in the sense of ""something"" or ""anything"" rather than a specific thing. The verb ""batana"" is in the infinitive form, which is used to indicate that the action of telling will be necessary or unavoidable. The word ""hoga"" is the future tense of the verb ""hona"", which means ""to be"". In this context, it is used to indicate that the action of telling will be necessary or unavoidable in the future. Therefore, the correct translation is ""I will have to tell them something"". (Source: English to Hindi Dictionary)"
