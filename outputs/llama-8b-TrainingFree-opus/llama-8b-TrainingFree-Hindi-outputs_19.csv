266,"लेकिन आप उन्हें प्रयोग महल पिघल और शहरों में जला है, आप अलग अलग नहीं कर रहे हैं।","But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.","But you're just talking, not doing anything.  Word-by-word translation: लेकिन (but) आप (you) उन्हें (them) प्रयोग (experiments) महल (palace) पिघल (melt) और (and) शहरों (cities) में (in) जला (burn) है (are) आप (you) अलग (different) अलग (different) नहीं (not) कर (do) रहे (are doing) हैं। (are)  Explanation: The idiom is a critique of the idea that some people are talking about change, but not actually doing anything to bring it about. The phrase ""प्रयोग महल"" (experiments palace) is a metaphor for the idea that people are talking about change, but not actually taking action to bring it about. The phrase ""शहरों में जला"" (burn cities) is a metaphor for the destructive consequences of inaction, and the phrase ""अलग अलग नहीं कर रहे हैं"" (are not differentiating) is a critique of the lack of action. The idiom is suggesting that some people are just talking about change, but not actually doing anything to bring it about.  Note: The idiom is a critique of the idea that some people are talking about change, but not actually doing anything to bring it about. It is not a direct translation of the English phrase ""you are not differentiating"", but rather a metaphorical expression that conveys a similar idea.  Reference: The idiom is likely derived from a phrase used by the Indian poet and philosopher, Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote about the importance of taking action to bring about change. The idiom may also be influenced by the idea of the ""palace of experiments"" as a metaphor for the idea of change as a process that requires action.  Source: The idiom is likely to be found in Indian literature and poetry, particularly in the works of Rabindranath Tagore and other Indian poets and philosophers who wrote about the importance of balancing talk with action.  Note: The idiom is a critique of the idea that some people are talking about change, but not actually doing anything to bring it about. It is a metaphorical expression that conveys a similar idea to the English phrase ""you are not differentiating"".  Word-by-word translation: लेकिन (but) आप (you) उन्हें (them) प्रयोग"
