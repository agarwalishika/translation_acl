生于忧患，死于安乐,"Life springs from sorrow and calamity, death comes from ease and pleasure","Born in trouble, die in peace","This idiom warns that too much comfort can lead to weakness and downfall, while adversity can foster strength and resilience. Answer: Born from worry, died from ease. Explanation: This idiom means that a person or organization is most likely to achieve success or prosperity when they are facing challenges and difficulties (worry), but they are most likely to decline or fall when they become complacent and lack motivation (ease). The idiom is derived from the history of the Qin and Han dynasties, where the Qin dynasty was born out of the chaos and turmoil of the Warring States period, but eventually collapsed due to its own complacency and corruption. The Han dynasty, on the other hand, was born out of the ashes of the Qin dynasty and was able to maintain its power and prosperity for centuries due to its ability to adapt and respond to challenges. The idiom is often used to caution against complacency and to encourage people to remain vigilant and proactive in the face of challenges.  Example: ""After years of hard work, the company finally achieved success, but now that it's reached the top, it's easy to become complacent and lose sight of the challenges that lie ahead. We must remember the idiom '生于忧患，死于安乐' and continue to innovate and improve in order to stay ahead of the competition.""  In this example, the speaker is reminding the company of the importance of staying vigilant and proactive in the face of challenges, lest they become complacent and lose their competitive edge.  Another example: ""The government's lack of attention to the country's economic problems has led to a period of economic growth, but now that the economy is booming, it's easy to become complacent and ignore the underlying issues that could lead to a downturn. We must remember the idiom '生于忧患，死于安乐' and continue to address the country's economic challenges in order to ensure long-term prosperity.""  In this example, the speaker is warning the government against becoming complacent and ignoring the underlying economic issues that could lead to a downturn.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal development, to caution against complacency and encourage people to remain vigilant and proactive in the face of challenges.  It's a reminder that success is often fleeting and that complacency can lead to decline and failure.  The idiom is also often used to encourage people to remain humble and grounded, even in the face of success, and"

Explanation: This idiom is used to describe the situation where a person tries to understand something by only experiencing a small part of it, without seeing the whole picture.

相辅相成,Supplement each other,Complement each other,"Their talents complemented each other, forming a powerful team. Answer: Their talents complemented each other, forming a powerful team. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe how two or more things complement each other to achieve a common goal. The word ""相"" means ""mutual"" or ""reciprocal"", ""辅"" means ""aid"" or ""assist"", and ""成"" means ""completion"" or ""fulfillment"". Therefore, the idiom ""相辅相成"" literally means ""mutual aid mutual completion"". The word ""相"" is used twice to emphasize the reciprocal nature of the relationship between the two things. The idiom is often used to describe the interdependence of two or more things, such as the relationship between two people, two organizations, or two concepts. For example, ""The company's success is due to the mutual aid mutual completion of the efforts of its employees and management.""

The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, education, and personal relationships. It emphasizes the importance of cooperation and mutual support in achieving success.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""相辅相成"" also has a deeper meaning that goes beyond its literal translation. It suggests that the success of one thing is dependent on the success of another, and that the two things are inextricably linked. It also implies that the relationship between the two things is one of interdependence, where each thing relies on the other to achieve its goals.  The idiom is often used to describe the relationship between two or more things that are complementary, such as the relationship between two people who are complementary in their skills and abilities. For example, ""The artist and the musician are complementary, and their collaboration is an example of 相辅相成.""

私相授受,Make an illicit transfer,Give and receive privately,"Private mutual giving and receiving  Explanation:  The idiom ""私相授受"" is a Chinese phrase that consists of two characters: ""私"" (private) and ""相授受"" (mutual giving and receiving). The word ""私"" means ""private"" or ""personal"", while ""相"" means ""mutual"" or ""reciprocal"", ""授"" means ""to give"", and ""受"" means ""to receive"". Therefore, the literal translation of the idiom is ""Private mutual giving and receiving"". This idiom is often used to describe a situation where two people have a close and intimate relationship, and they exchange favors or secrets with each other.  In this context, the idiom emphasizes the private and personal nature of the exchange, as well as the mutual and reciprocal aspect of it.  The idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is receiving something from someone else, but not openly or publicly.  For example, ""他们私相授受，互相帮助"" means ""They have a private mutual giving and receiving relationship, helping each other in secret"".  Overall, the idiom ""私相授受"" highlights the importance of trust, loyalty, and discretion in personal relationships.  It suggests that when people have a private and mutual understanding with each other, they can rely on each other and work together in a way that is not visible to others.  This idiom is often used in Chinese literature and everyday conversation to convey a sense of closeness and solidarity between people.  It is a powerful tool for describing complex social relationships and the dynamics of personal connections.  In addition, the idiom ""私相授受"" can also be used to describe a situation where someone is receiving a benefit or favor from someone else, but not openly or publicly.  For example, ""他私相授受，获得了升职"" means ""He received a promotion through private mutual giving and receiving"".  In this context, the idiom suggests that the person received the promotion not because of their own merit, but because of their connections and relationships with others.  Overall, the idiom ""私相授受"" is a rich and nuanced concept that highlights the complexities of human relationships and the importance of trust, loyalty, and discretion.  It is a valuable tool for understanding the social dynamics of Chinese culture and the ways in which people interact with each other.

积年累月,For months and years,Over the years,"Accumulated year by year, accumulated month by month. Answer: Over the years. Explanation: This idiom is often used to describe a gradual process that has been going on for a long time. The word ""年"" (year) and ""月"" (month) are used to indicate a long period of time, with ""年"" representing a larger unit of time and ""月"" representing a smaller unit. The verb ""积累"" (accumulate) is used to describe the process of adding up or piling up something over time. The idiom is often used in a context where something has been building up or increasing gradually over a long period, such as ""积年累月的努力"" (years of hard work) or ""积年累月的经验"" (years of experience). Example: 积年累月的努力终于得到了回报。 (Years of hard work finally paid off.) Note: This idiom is often used in a more formal or literary context, and is less commonly used in everyday conversation. Source: This idiom is a combination of two Chinese characters: ""积"" (accumulate) and ""年累月"" (year by year, month by month). The character ""积"" is a verb that means to accumulate or pile up, while ""年累月"" is a phrase that means year by year, month by month. The two characters are combined to form a new idiom that means to accumulate or build up something over a long period of time. Reference: This idiom is listed in the Chinese Dictionary of Idioms, which is a comprehensive dictionary of Chinese idioms and phrases. The dictionary defines the idiom as ""to accumulate or build up something over a long period of time"" and provides examples of how it is used in context.
