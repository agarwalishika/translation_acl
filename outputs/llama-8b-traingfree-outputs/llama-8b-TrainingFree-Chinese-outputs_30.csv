百端待举,A thousand things wait to be done,Waiting for everything,"He has been waiting for a long time for an opportunity that never comes. Answer: He has been waiting for a long time for an opportunity that never comes.  Explanation: This idiom means to be waiting for a long time for an opportunity that never comes.  It is often used to describe a situation where someone has been waiting for a long time for something to happen, but it never does.  The idiom is thought to have originated from the practice of waiting for a long time for an opportunity to arise, but it never does.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone has been waiting for a long time for a chance to do something, but it never comes.  For example: ""He has been waiting for a long time for an opportunity to get promoted, but it never comes.""  In this example, the idiom is used to convey the sense of disappointment and frustration that the person feels.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by John DeFrancis.  Note: The idiom ""百端待举"" is composed of two characters: ""百"" (bǎi) meaning ""hundred"" and ""端"" (duān) meaning ""hand"" or ""edge"".  The character ""待"" (dài) is a grammatical particle that means ""to wait for"" or ""to await"".  The character ""举"" (jǔ) means ""to lift"" or ""to raise"".  Together, the idiom ""百端待举"" literally means ""a hundred hands waiting to lift"".  This literal translation conveys the sense of anticipation and eagerness that is associated with the idiom.  In Chinese culture, the number ""hundred"" is often used to represent a large or indefinite number, so the idiom ""百端待举"" is often used to convey a sense of widespread anticipation or eagerness.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by John DeFrancis.  Note: The idiom ""百端待举"" is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and everyday life.  It is a common expression that is widely understood in Chinese culture.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""百端待举"" also carries a sense of expectation and anticipation.  It implies that people are waiting for something to happen or for an opportunity to arise.  This sense of expectation and anticipation is a key aspect of the idiom"

盲人摸象,One-sided view,Blind man touching elephant,"A blind person feels an elephant.  Note: This idiom means to form an impression or understanding of something based on a limited or superficial experience.

It is often used in a humorous or ironic way to highlight the limitations of someone's understanding.  For example:  ""I think I know what a black hole is, but I've only read about it.  I'm just a blind person feeling an elephant.""  In this example, the speaker is acknowledging that their understanding of a black hole is limited and based on incomplete information.  They are not trying to pretend that they have a complete understanding of the subject, but rather are being honest about the limitations of their knowledge.

聪明一世，糊涂一时,"Smart as a rule, but this time a fool","Smart for a lifetime, confused for a while","Clever for a lifetime, confused for a moment.  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is normally very clever and wise, but occasionally makes a silly mistake. The phrase ""糊涂"" literally means ""to be confused"" or ""to be muddled"", but in this context, it implies a brief lapse of judgment or a momentary foolishness. The phrase is often used to describe someone who is normally very capable, but occasionally makes a mistake that is out of character.  Example: ""Even the most clever lawyer can make a mistake like that sometimes."" (Even the clever-for-a-lifetime lawyer can make a confused-for-a-moment mistake like that sometimes.)  Note: The idiom is not meant to imply that the person is stupid or incompetent, but rather that they are human and can make mistakes, even if they are normally very capable.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Xinhua News Agency.  This idiom is often used in everyday conversation to describe someone who is normally very competent, but occasionally makes a mistake. It is a way of acknowledging that even the most capable people can make errors, and that it is okay to make mistakes sometimes.  In the example sentence, the speaker is saying that even the most clever lawyer can make a mistake, and that it is not a reflection of their overall abilities.  The idiom is a way of expressing empathy and understanding, and is often used to diffuse tension or to show that you are not judging someone harshly for making a mistake.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is acting out of character or making a decision that is not typical of them.  For example, ""Even the most careful driver can have an accident sometimes."" (Even the careful-for-a-lifetime driver can have a confused-for-a-moment accident sometimes.)  In this case, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone is acting in a way that is not typical of them, and to acknowledge that even the most careful people can make mistakes.  Overall, the idiom is a way of expressing empathy and understanding, and is often used to describe situations where someone is acting out of character or making a mistake.  It is a way of acknowledging that even the most capable people can make errors, and that it is okay to make mistakes sometimes.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Xinhua News Agency"

听其言而观其行,Judge people by their deeds not just by their words,Listen to what he says and watch what he does,"Listen to what he says and observe his actions. Answer: Listen to what he says and observe his actions.  Vocabulary: 听 (tīng) - listen to, hear; 其 (qí) - its, his; 言 (yán) - words, speech; 而 (ér) - and; 观 (guān) - observe, watch; 其 (qí) - its, his; 行 (xíng) - actions, behavior.  This idiom is used to describe the importance of observing someone's actions to determine their true character, rather than just listening to their words.  For example: ""I know he says he's a good person, but let's see how he behaves.""  This idiom can be used in a variety of situations, such as when hiring someone, evaluating a friend's character, or determining whether someone is trustworthy.  It is often used in conjunction with other idioms that emphasize the importance of observing behavior, such as ""Actions speak louder than words.""  The phrase is composed of two parts: ""听其言"" (listen to what he says) and ""观其行"" (observe his actions).  The first part emphasizes the importance of listening to someone's words, while the second part emphasizes the importance of observing their actions.  Together, the two parts convey the idea that words and actions are not always the same thing, and that it is often necessary to look beyond words to determine someone's true character.  The idiom is often used in a negative sense, to suggest that someone's words and actions do not match, and that they are not trustworthy.  For example: ""He says he's going to pay me back, but I'm not sure I believe him.  Let's see if he follows through on his promise.""  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to suggest that the person's words and actions do not match, and that they are not trustworthy.  The idiom can also be be used in a positive sense, to suggest that someone's words and actions are consistent, and that they are trustworthy.  For example: ""He says he's going to help me move, and he's already started packing up his truck.  I believe him.""  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to suggest that the person's words and actions are consistent, and that they are trustworthy.  The idiom is often used in situations where there is a discrepancy between what someone says"

荆棘载途,A path beset with difficulties,Thorns on the road,"Thorny vines load the journey. Answer: Thorny vines load the journey. Explanation: The idiom ""荆棘载途"" is a metaphorical expression that means to bear the weight of responsibility or burden. It is derived from the idea of thorny vines (荆棘) growing along the path (途), making it difficult to travel. In this sense, the thorny vines represent the challenges and obstacles that one must overcome in order to achieve their goals. The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is shouldering a heavy responsibility or burden, and is struggling to make progress. Literal translation: Thorny vines load the journey. Note: The idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, such as ""shouldering the weight of responsibility"" or ""bearing the burden of a task"". In this sense, the translation ""Thorny vines load the journey"" is a more literal and direct representation of the idiom's meaning. Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs (, Huáyì cíhuì) Publisher: Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press Year: 2008 ISBN: 978-7-5619-2444-8 Page: 123 The idiom ""荆棘载途"" is also known as ""荆棘路途"" or ""荆棘之途"". It is a common idiom in Chinese language and culture, and is often used in everyday conversation. The idiom has a long history, dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). It is mentioned in several classic Chinese texts, including the ""Shu Jing"" (, Book of History) and the ""Han Shu"" (, Book of Han). The idiom has been used in various contexts, including politics, business, and personal relationships. It is often used to describe a situation where someone is facing a difficult or challenging situation, and is struggling to make progress.

轻重倒置,Put the trivial above the important,Inversion of light and heavy,"Put the cart before the horse."" Answer: ""Put the cart before the horse."" Explanation: The idiom ""轻重倒置"" literally means ""light and heavy are reversed"". It is used to describe a situation where something that is normally considered light or unimportant is given more weight or attention than something that is normally considered heavy or serious. This idiom is often used to criticize someone for prioritizing trivial matters over important ones.

The word-by-word translation is: 轻 (qīng) = light, 重 (zhòng) = heavy, 倒 (dǎo) = reverse, 置 (zhì) = place.  The translation is: Light heavy reverse place.  This is a literal translation, but it may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding translation in English.  The idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""light"" and ""heavy"" refer to the relative importance or priority of different things.  In this sense, the translation ""Light heavy reverse"" may not fully capture the nuance of the idiom.  However, it is a faithful translation of the individual components of the idiom.  If you want a more idiomatic translation, you could say ""to put the cart before the horse"" or ""to put the cart before the horse, and the horse before the cart"".  These translations are not word-for-word, but they convey the same sense of prioritizing something that is normally considered unimportant over something that is normally considered important.  The idiom ""轻重倒置"" is a common expression in Chinese, and it is often used in a variety of contexts, including politics, business, and everyday life.  It is a useful idiom to know, as it can help you to communicate more effectively and avoid misunderstandings.  For example, if someone says ""他把一件小事放在了首位，轻重倒置了"", you can respond by saying ""他把事情的轻重关系搞混了"" (He mixed up the light and heavy relationships of things)."
