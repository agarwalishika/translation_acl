Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who harbors intense hatred towards someone or something. The word ""仇"" (enemy) is used to convey the idea of a deep-seated and intense animosity. The phrase ""疾恶"" (hate intensely) is a common expression that emphasizes the strength of one's hatred. Together, the idiom ""疾恶如仇"" suggests a level of hatred that is comparable to the animosity one would feel towards a sworn enemy. Example: ""他对我恨之入骨，疾恶如仇。"" (He hates me with a passion, and his hatred is like that of an enemy.) In this example, the speaker is describing someone who has a deep-seated and intense hatred towards them. The use of the idiom ""疾恶如仇"" emphasizes the strength and intensity of this hatred. Note: The idiom ""疾恶如仇"" is often used in a negative context to describe someone who harbors intense hatred towards others. However, it can also be used in a more neutral or even positive context to describe someone who is fiercely loyal or protective of their loved ones. For example: ""他对自己的家人疾恶如仇，保护他们如生命。"" (He hates anyone who threatens his family, and he would do anything to protect them.) In this example, the speaker is describing someone who is fiercely loyal and protective of their loved ones, and the use of the idiom ""疾恶如仇"" emphasizes the strength of their devotion.

穿针引线,Act as a go-between,Thread the needle,"He used his connections to thread a needle and pull the company into a large deal. Answer: He used his connections to pull a thread to unravel a whole piece of cloth. Explanation: This idiom means to cause a small problem to escalate into a major issue. The idea is that a single thread can be pulled to unravel the entire fabric, implying that a small problem can quickly escalate into a much larger one. This idiom is often used to caution against underestimating the potential consequences of a small issue. It can also be used to describe a situation where a person's careless or thoughtless words or actions have caused a significant disturbance or problem. In general, the idiom is used to convey the idea that even the smallest problem can have far-reaching and unintended consequences. The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that the person who caused the problem is careless or thoughtless, and that they should have been more careful or considerate in their words or actions. However, the idiom can also be used in a more neutral sense, simply to describe a situation where a small problem has escalated into a major issue, without necessarily implying blame or fault. Overall, the idiom is a useful way to convey the idea that even the smallest problem can have significant consequences, and that it's often better to address problems promptly and carefully to avoid them escalating into major issues. In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used figuratively to describe a situation where a small issue is blown out of proportion by external factors, such as media attention or public opinion. In this sense, the idiom suggests that a small problem can be amplified and distorted by external forces, leading to a much larger and more complex issue. The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal relationships. In business, the idiom can be used to describe a situation where a small mistake or problem has escalated into a major issue, such as a product recall or a public relations crisis. In politics, the idiom can be used to describe a situation where a small issue has been blown out of proportion by the media or public opinion, leading to a major controversy or scandal. In personal relationships, the idiom can be used to describe a situation where a small issue has escalated into a major conflict or argument. For example: ""He said one unhappy word and the whole team got upset, it's really like pulling a thread to unravel a whole piece of cloth."" In this example, the person is"

聪明反被聪明误,Cleverness may overreach itself,Smart is mistaken by smart,"Cleverness is counterproductive to cleverness being mistaken. Answer: He was outwitted by his own cleverness. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where someone's cleverness or intelligence leads them to make a mistake or fall into a trap. The word ""反"" means ""counter"" or ""against"", and ""误"" means ""mistake"". Therefore, the idiom is literally saying that cleverness is counterproductive to cleverness being mistaken. This means that the person's cleverness is actually causing them to make a mistake, rather than helping them avoid it. The idiom is often used to caution people against overestimating their own abilities or being too clever for their own good. It can also be used to describe a situation where someone's cleverness is being used against them, such as in a game or a puzzle.

In this case, the person's cleverness was counterproductive to solving the puzzle, and they ended up making a mistake. Another example: ""He was so clever that he fell into the trap set by his opponent."" In this case, the person's cleverness was counterproductive to avoiding the trap, and he ended up getting caught. Overall, the idiom is a reminder that cleverness can sometimes be a double-edged sword, and that it's possible to be too clever for one's own good. It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of overconfidence and the importance of humility. It's also a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solution is the best one, and that cleverness can sometimes get in the way of common sense. The idiom is often used in situations where someone is being too clever or too clever for their own good, and it's a way of saying that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their approach. It's a reminder that cleverness is not always the answer, and that sometimes, it's better to be simple and straightforward. In conclusion, the idiom ""聪明反被聪明误"" is a valuable reminder about the importance of humility and the dangers of overconfidence. It's a cautionary tale that encourages people to be mindful of their own cleverness and to avoid being too clever for their own good. It's a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solution is the best one, and that cleverness can sometimes get in the way of common sense. Answer: He was outwitted"

猫哭耗子,Shed crocodile tears,Cat crying mouse,"It was just like the cat crying for mouse. Answer: It was just like the cat crying for mouse. Explanation: This idiom means to mourn or lament for someone who is already dead. The phrase is a play on the common phrase ""cat crying for mouse"", which is a metaphor for a futile or hopeless situation, as cats are known to be predators of mice. In this idiom, the cat is mourning the death of its prey, implying that the mourning is also futile. The phrase is often used to describe someone who is grieving for someone who is already gone, or someone who is holding onto a lost cause.  Example: ""After the accident, she kept crying and mourning, but it was just like the cat crying for mouse, there was nothing she could do to bring him back.""  In this example, the speaker is saying that the woman's grief is futile, and that she should accept the reality of the situation.  Note: This idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is being overly sentimental or dramatic.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs, by Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi.  Note: The original phrase ""猫哭耗子"" is a play on the common phrase ""猫哭老鼠"", which is a more common idiom in Chinese.  The difference between the two phrases is that ""猫哭耗子"" uses the character """" (hào zǐ) instead of """" (lǎo shǔ), which means ""mouse"" or ""rodent"".  The character """" (hào zǐ) is a more poetic way of referring to a mouse, and it adds to the whimsical and humorous tone of the idiom.  In Chinese culture, cats are often seen as symbols of good luck and prosperity, while mice are seen as symbols of bad luck and misfortune.  Therefore, the phrase ""猫哭耗子"" is a clever play on these cultural associations, and it adds to the humor and irony of the idiom.  Note: The phrase ""猫哭耗子"" is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is being overly sentimental or dramatic.  It is not meant to be taken literally, and it is not a phrase that should be used in a serious or somber context.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs, by Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi.  Note: The original phrase ""猫哭耗子"" is a play on the common phrase"
负重致远,(of a person) be able to shoulder important tasks,Carrying weight goes far,"To achieve success, one must be willing to face challenges and difficulties.  Literal:  Carrying heavy weights leads to far-off places.  I used ""leads to"" instead of ""results in"" or ""causes"" because the verb ""致"" can be translated to ""leads to"" or ""results in"", but in this case, it's more like ""leads to"" or ""takes to"".  ""致远"" is a verb phrase, which means to travel to a far-off place.  ""负重"" means carrying heavy weights.  So, the idiom ""负重致远"" means carrying heavy weights leads to traveling to a far-off place.  It's a metaphorical expression that means to take a long and difficult journey to achieve a goal.  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is willing to take risks and face challenges in order to achieve success.  It's a very common idiom in Chinese and is often used in business, education, and other fields.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

软硬皆施,Use both persuasion and force (or coercion),Both soft and hard,"Soft hard both apply Answer: Soft hard both apply Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where both soft words and harsh measures are used to achieve a goal. The word ""施"" (apply) is used here to indicate the action of using or implementing something. In this context, it means to use both soft words (e.g. persuasion, negotiation) and harsh measures (e.g. punishment, coercion) to achieve a desired outcome. The idiom suggests that a combination of both approaches is necessary to be effective. Example sentence: ""The government used soft words to persuade the public, but also applied harsh measures to maintain order."" In this example, the government is using both soft words (persuasion) and harsh measures (maintenance of order) to achieve their goal. The idiom can also be used in a more general sense to describe a situation where someone is using a combination of different approaches to achieve a goal. For example: ""The salesperson used soft words to build rapport with the customer, but also applied harsh measures to push for a sale."" In this example, the salesperson is using both soft words (building rapport) and harsh measures (pushing for a sale) to achieve their goal.

It implies that a single approach may not be enough, and that a combination of soft words and harsh measures is necessary to achieve the desired outcome. The idiom is often used in a business or political context, but it can also be used in a more general sense to describe a situation where someone is using a combination of different approaches to achieve a goal. It is a useful idiom to know, as it can help to describe complex situations and strategies in a concise and effective way. The idiom is often used in combination with other idioms or phrases to create a more nuanced and detailed description of a situation. For example: ""The company used a combination of soft words and harsh measures to achieve its goals, but ultimately failed to"
