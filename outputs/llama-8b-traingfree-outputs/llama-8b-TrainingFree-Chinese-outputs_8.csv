添枝加叶,Embellish a story,Add branches and leaves,"Add oil add vinegar Answer: to embellish or exaggerate something, often to make it more interesting or impressive.  Example sentence: 他在讲故事时, 总是添油加醋, 让听众感到困惑。 (He always embellishes or exaggerates when telling stories, making the listeners feel confused.) Answer: He always embellishes or exaggerates when telling stories, making the listeners feel confused.  Note: This idiom is often used to describe someone who is prone to exaggeration or embellishment, often to the point of making their story unbelievable or untrustworthy.  In this example, the speaker is implying that the storyteller is not being truthful or accurate, and is instead adding fictional details to make their story more engaging or impressive.  This idiom is often used in everyday conversation to express skepticism or disappointment with someone's storytelling or exaggeration.  In addition to its literal meaning, this idiom can also be used to describe someone who is prone to embellishing the truth in other areas of life, such as in their resume, in their writing, or in their conversations.  Overall, 添枝加叶 is a useful idiom to know when communicating with native Chinese speakers, as it can help you express your skepticism or disappointment with someone's exaggeration or embellishment.  However, I noticed that the idiom ""添枝加叶"" is not commonly used in everyday conversation.  It's more of a formal or literary expression.  If you want to express the same idea in a more casual or conversational way, you could use the idiom ""添油加醋"" (tiān yóu jiā cù).  This idiom has a more natural and idiomatic translation.  The literal translation of ""添油加醋"" is ""add oil add vinegar"", but the idiomatic translation is ""to embellish or exaggerate something, often to make it more interesting or impressive"".  This idiom is often used to describe someone who is prone to exaggeration or embellishment, often to the point of making their story unbelievable or untrustworthy.  In this example, the speaker is implying that the storyteller is not being truthful or accurate, and is instead adding fictional details to make their story more engaging or impressive.

无米之炊,Make bricks without straw,Cooking without rice,"The cooking without rice.  Explanation: The idiom ""无米之炊"" is a literal translation of the Chinese phrase. ""无米"" means ""without rice"" and ""之炊"" means ""the cooking"". Therefore, the translation is ""The cooking without rice"". This idiom is often used to describe a situation where there is no substance or content to support a particular activity or endeavor. It is often used to convey that something is futile or pointless. For example, ""他在做无米之炊"" means ""He is doing something without any substance or content"".  Note: The idiom ""无米之炊"" is often used in a negative sense to describe a situation that is lacking in substance or content. It is not typically used to describe a situation where someone is cooking without rice, but rather to describe a situation where there is no substance or content to support a particular activity or endeavor.  In this sense, the translation ""The cooking without rice"" is a literal translation of the idiom, but it does not convey the full meaning or nuance of the idiom.  A more idiomatic translation of the idiom would be ""Cooking without rice"" or ""Futile endeavor"".  However, for the purpose of this exercise, the literal translation ""The cooking without rice"" is the correct answer."

无计可施,Utterly without resources,Nothing can be done,"No plan can be implemented. Answer:  No plan can be implemented.  Note:  ""施"" is a verb that means ""to put into effect"" or ""to carry out"".  Therefore, ""无计可施"" means that there are no plans that can be put into effect.  This idiom is often used to describe a situation where one is unable to find a solution to a problem.  It is similar to the English idiom ""no way out"".  Example:  ""无计可施"" 的情况下, 我们只能等待。  (In a situation where there are no plans that can be put into effect, we can only wait.)  In this example, the speaker is saying that they are unable to find a solution to the problem and are therefore left with no choice but to wait.  This idiom is often used in situations where one is faced with a difficult or impossible problem.  It is a common idiom in Chinese and is widely used in everyday language.  The literal translation of the idiom is ""no plan can be implemented"", but it is often used in a more figurative sense to describe a situation where one is unable to find a solution to a problem.  The idiom is often used in conjunction with other idioms or phrases to convey a sense of frustration or desperation.  For example:  ""无计可施, 只能等待""  (There are no plans that can be put into effect, we can only wait.)  In this example, the speaker is saying that they are unable to find a solution to the problem and are therefore left with no choice but to wait.  The idiom is often used in situations where one is faced with a difficult or impossible problem, and is a common idiom in Chinese.  It is widely used in everyday language and is often used in conjunction with other idioms or phrases to convey a sense of frustration or desperation.  The idiom is also used in a more figurative sense to describe a situation where one is unable to find a solution to a problem, and is often used in conjunction with other idioms or phrases to convey a sense of hopelessness or despair.  For example:  ""无计可施, 只能绝望""  (There are no plans that can be put into effect, we can only give up hope.)  In this example, the speaker is saying that they are unable to find a solution to the problem and are therefore left with no choice"

为虎傅翼,Assist an evil-doer,Fu Yi for the tiger,Chinese Idioms are a fascinating topic.
为虎作伥,Help a villain do evil,Play for the tiger,"To serve a tiger by acting as a dog.  Explanation: This idiom means to act as a subordinate or assistant to someone who is powerful or has a lot of influence, often in a way that is humiliating or degrading. The phrase is thought to have originated from a story in which a man who was a servant to a tiger would pretend to be a dog in order to gain the tiger's trust and avoid being eaten.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe situations in which someone is forced to act in a subservient or humiliating way in order to achieve their goals or gain favor.  For example, ""He had to serve the powerful CEO by acting as his personal assistant, which was a humiliating experience for him.""  This idiom is often used to convey a sense of resentment or frustration at being in a subordinate position.

Explanation: This idiom is used to describe the feeling of nostalgia or wistfulness that comes from seeing something that reminds one of a person, often a loved one who is no longer present. The phrase is composed of two characters: 睦物 (dù wù), meaning ""to see things,"" and 思人 (sī rén), meaning ""to think of people."" When combined, the phrase suggests a moment of introspection or reminiscence that arises from encountering something that evokes memories of a person.  Example: ""When I saw the old photo, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. It made me think of my grandmother, and I felt a lump in my throat. It's a classic case of 睦物思人.""  In this example, the speaker is describing a moment when seeing an old photo triggered a strong emotional response, making them think of their grandmother and feel a sense of longing. The idiom captures the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and the way it can be triggered by even the smallest reminders of a loved one.  Other examples: ""The sunset on the beach made me think of my childhood vacations with my family. It's a classic case of 睦物思人."" ""When I saw the old high school, I felt a wave of nostalgia wash over me. It made me think of my friends and the good times we had. It's a classic case of 睦物思人.""  In both examples, the speaker is describing a moment when seeing something that reminds them of a person or a past experience triggers a strong emotional response, making them think of that person or experience. The idiom is often used to describe the way that memories can be triggered by even the smallest reminders, and the way that nostalgia can be a powerful and bittersweet emotion.  In Chinese culture, the idiom is often used to describe the way that people can become lost in thought when they see something that reminds them of a loved one. It's a common experience that many people can relate to, and the idiom captures the complexity and depth of human emotions.  The idiom has been used in various contexts, including literature, poetry, and everyday conversation.

万寿无疆,(wish somebody) a long life,Longevity without borders,Literal translation:
万水千山,Ten thousand crags and torrents,Thousands of Waters and Thousands of Mountains,"A long and difficult journey, requiring determination and perseverance."
落花有意，流水无情,Unrequited love,"Falling flowers are intentional, flowing water is ruthless",- 1.
落井下石,Strike (or hit) a person when he is down,Fall into the hole,"Throw well down stone  Explanation: This idiom means to add insult to injury or to make a bad situation worse. It is a literal translation of the phrase, which consists of two verbs: ""落"" (to fall) and ""下"" (to put down), and two nouns: ""井"" (well) and ""石"" (stone). The phrase is thought to have originated from the practice of throwing stones down a well to make the water muddy, thereby making it difficult for others to draw water. In modern usage, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone is already in a difficult or unfortunate position, and then someone else makes things worse for them.  Example: ""After losing his job, he received a huge tax bill. His boss's refusal to give him a reference was like throwing him down a well without a rope."" (Here, the boss's refusal to give a reference is like adding insult to injury, making the situation even worse for the person who has already lost his job.)  Note: This idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""stone"" is not literally thrown down a well, but rather represents a hurtful or damaging action.  In this sense, the idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is already in a difficult or unfortunate position, and then someone else makes things worse for them.  For example: ""After the accident, the insurance company refused to pay for his medical expenses. This was like throwing him down a well without a rope."" (Here, the insurance company's refusal to pay is like adding insult to injury, making the situation even worse for the person who has already been injured in the accident.)  In both examples, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone is already in a difficult or unfortunate position, and then someone else makes things worse for them.  The idiom is often used to express sympathy or outrage at the situation, and to suggest that the person who made things worse is responsible for the additional suffering.  In some cases, the idiom may also be used to describe a situation where someone is taking advantage of another person's misfortune, or where someone is being cruel or heartless.  For example: ""The landlord raised the rent after the tenant's business went bankrupt. This was like throwing him down a well without a rope."" (Here, the landlord's decision to raise the rent is like adding insult to injury, taking advantage of the tenant's misfortune.)"

贼喊捉贼,The devil rebuking a sin,Thief shouting catch thief,"Thieves shout catch thieves. Answer: Thieves shout catch thieves. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where people are accusing others of doing something wrong, but in reality, they are the ones who are guilty of the same thing. The phrase ""贼"" (zéi) means ""thief"" or ""bandit"", and the verb ""喊"" (hǎn) means ""to shout"". The phrase is a play on words, suggesting that the people shouting are the ones who are actually guilty of the same crime.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe a situation where people are accusing others of hypocrisy or double standards.  For example: ""You're accusing me of being late, but you're always late yourself. That's like thieves shouting catch thieves!"" (你在指责我迟到，但你自己经常迟到。这就像贼喊捉贼一样!)  In this example, the speaker is pointing out the hypocrisy of the person accusing them of being late, when in reality, the accuser is also guilty of being late.  The idiom is often used to highlight the absurdity or hypocrisy of a situation.  It's a clever play on words that has become a common expression in Chinese culture.
