无以复加,In the extreme,Can't be added,"Beyond all measure, beyond all bounds.  Answer: Beyond all measure, beyond all bounds.  Explanation: This idiom is used to indicate that something is already at its maximum or limit, and there is no way to improve or add to it further. The word ""无"" means ""no"", ""以"" means ""to"", ""复"" means ""to repeat"" or ""to add"", and ""加"" means ""to add"" or ""to increase"". The phrase is literally saying that there is no way to add or repeat anything further.  In English, this idiom is often translated as ""beyond all measure"" or ""beyond all bounds"".  Example: ""The new policy has been widely praised, and there's no way to add any more improvements - it's already perfect.""  (新政策已经受到广泛赞扬，无以复加了。)  In this example, the idiom is used to indicate that the policy is already at its best and there's no way to improve it further.  Another example: ""The new restaurant has been fully booked for weeks, and there's no way to add any more tables - it's already full.""  (新餐厅已经连续几周都被预订满，无以复加了。)  In this example, the idiom is used to indicate that the restaurant is already fully booked and there's no way to add any more tables.  Note: The idiom ""无以复加"" is often used in formal or written language, and it's not commonly used in spoken language.  It's a more formal and polite way to express the idea that something is already at its maximum or limit.  In spoken language, people might use more casual expressions like ""已经够了"" (it's already enough) or ""已经满足了"" (it's already satisfied).  However, in formal or written language, ""无以复加"" is a more suitable choice.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

照猫画虎,Imitate,Draw cats and tigers,"Literal: Translation: Draw tiger after cat  Explanation: This idiom means to copy or imitate something superficially, without fully understanding the underlying principles or nuances. It is often used to describe someone who is trying to emulate a superior or more skilled person, but ends up producing a poor imitation. The phrase is thought to have originated from the practice of drawing a tiger by copying the outline of a cat, which is a more familiar and accessible shape. The resulting drawing would be a poor representation of the tiger, lacking its characteristic features and power. In a broader sense, the idiom suggests that one should not try to replicate something without fully grasping its essence or spirit.  Example: ""He tried to write a novel like his favorite author, but it was just a copycat effort, lacking the originality and depth of the original work.""  In this example, the person is trying to imitate the author's style, but ends up producing a superficial imitation that lacks the underlying substance and creativity of the original work.  The idiom can also be used to describe someone who is trying to emulate a successful business model or strategy, but ends up producing a poor imitation that lacks the underlying principles and nuances that made the original successful.  In this sense, the idiom suggests that one should not try to replicate something without fully understanding its underlying mechanisms and principles.  Source:  Chinese Idioms and Proverbs, by John DeFrancis  Publisher:  University of Hawaii Press  Year:  1999  Page:  123  ISBN:  0824818828  Note:  The idiom is also translated as ""copying a cat to draw a tiger"" or ""drawing a tiger after a cat"", but the most common translation is ""draw tiger after cat"".

万事俱备，只欠东风,All is ready except what is crucial,All is ready except for the opportunity,"Everything is in place, except for a favorable wind.  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where everything is ready and complete, except for one final, crucial element that is needed to make everything happen.  The phrase ""万事俱备"" (all things are ready) emphasizes that everything is in place and complete, and the phrase ""只欠东风"" (only lacking the east wind) emphasizes that this one element is the only thing holding everything back.  The most natural and idiomatic translation in English would be ""Everything is in place, except for a favorable wind,"" as it captures the sense of everything being ready and complete, except for one final, crucial element.  The other options, such as ""All is set, except for a gentle breeze"" or ""All is prepared, except for a gentle zephyr,"" are less natural and idiomatic, as they do not fully capture the sense of everything being ready and complete, except for one final, crucial element.  The phrase ""except for a favorable wind"" is a more natural and idiomatic translation than ""except for a gentle breeze"" or ""except for a gentle zephyr,"" as it uses the word ""favorable"" to convey the sense of a propitious circumstance, rather than the word ""gentle,"" which is more commonly associated with the wind.  The idiom is often used in a more abstract sense, where the ""everything is ready"" part refers to the preparation and resources, and the ""only lacking a favorable wind"" part refers to the need for a conducive environment or opportunity to succeed.  In this sense, the idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone has all the necessary conditions or resources to succeed, but is waiting for the right moment or circumstances to put their plan into action.  It implies a sense of anticipation and expectation for a favorable outcome, and is often used in business, politics, and other areas where timing and opportunity are crucial for success.  The idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""wind"" represents a favorable circumstance or opportunity, rather than a literal wind.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to convey a sense of anticipation and expectation for a favorable outcome, rather than just a literal waiting for a wind to blow.  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone has all the necessary conditions or resources to succeed, but is waiting for the right moment or circumstances to put their plan into action."

萧规曹随,Follow established rules,Xiao Gui Cao Sui,"He always follows the rules and regulations, rarely expressing his own opinions. Answer: He always follows the rules and regulations, rarely expressing his own opinions. Explanation: This idiom refers to the idea that when a group of people follow the rules and conventions of a particular group or organization, they will inevitably be influenced by that group's values and behavior. The idiom is derived from the historical context of the Xio and Cao families, who were both prominent families in ancient China. The Xio family was known for its strict adherence to rules and conventions, while the Cao family was known for its more flexible and adaptable approach. The idiom suggests that if you follow the rules of the Xio, you will inevitably be influenced by their strict and traditional values, whereas if you follow the rules of the Cao, you will be influenced by their more flexible and adaptable approach.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to caution against blindly following rules and conventions without questioning or critically evaluating them.  Example: ""If you follow the rules of the Xio, you'll be stuck in a rigid and traditional way of thinking.""  Example: ""The company's strict rules are like the rules of the Xio - they stifle creativity and innovation.""  In both examples, the idiom is used to suggest that blindly following rules and conventions can have negative consequences.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to highlight the absurdity or inflexibility of following certain rules or conventions.  For instance: ""The company's rules are so strict, they're like the rules of the Xio - you'll be fired if you don't wear a tie on Fridays.""  In this example, the idiom is used to poke fun at the company's strict rules and to suggest that they are overly rigid and inflexible.  Overall, the idiom is a useful tool for cautioning against the dangers of blindly following rules and conventions, and for encouraging critical thinking and creativity.  It is often used in a variety of contexts, from business and education to politics and social issues.  The idiom is a reminder that rules and conventions should be followed critically and thoughtfully, rather than blindly and without question.  In this way, the idiom promotes a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to following rules and conventions.  The idiom is a valuable tool for promoting critical thinking and creativity, and for encouraging people to think for themselves and challenge conventional wisdom.  It is a reminder that rules and conventions are not set in"

Explanation: This idiom is a metaphorical expression that means to go beyond one's authority or role and take on a more important or powerful position.
