画虎类狗,Attempting more than one has ability for,Drawing tiger dog,"Paint tiger resemble dog. Answer: Paint tiger resemble dog. Explanation: This idiom means to describe something as being like something else, but not accurately. It is often used to describe someone who is trying to pass off something inferior as something superior. The phrase ""paint tiger"" is a metaphor for describing a tiger, but not actually painting one. Similarly, ""resemble dog"" means to describe something as being like a dog, but not actually being one. The idiom is often used to criticize someone who is trying to deceive or mislead others by describing something inaccurately.  Example: ""He said the new restaurant was 'five-star', but it was really just a 'three-star' place. He was just painting tiger and resembling dog.""  In this example, the speaker is saying that the person was trying to describe the restaurant as being superior (five-star) when it was actually inferior (three-star). The speaker is using the idiom to criticize the person for trying to deceive others.  Note: The idiom is often used in a negative sense, but it can also be used in a more neutral or humorous way to describe someone who is trying to be overly flattering or generous in their descriptions.  For example: ""The politician was painting tiger and resembling dog when he said the new policy would create 'millions of jobs'.""  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to suggest that the politician is being overly optimistic or exaggerating the benefits of the policy.  Overall, the idiom is a useful way to describe someone who is trying to describe something inaccurately or misleadingly.  It is often used in a variety of contexts, including politics, business, and everyday conversation.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs, by John DeFrancis, 1999.  Note: The idiom is often used in a more formal or written context, but it can also be used in spoken language.  It is a common idiom in Chinese culture and is widely understood by native speakers.  The idiom is often used to add flavor and interest to language, and to convey complex ideas or emotions in a concise and memorable way.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs, by John DeFrancis, 1999.

盛名难副,It is hard to live up to a great reputation,Famous is hard to match,"It's hard to live up to your reputation. Answer: It's hard to live up to your reputation.  Explanation: The idiom ""盛名难副"" is a Chinese proverb that means ""a famous name is hard to live up to."" It suggests that when someone becomes famous, it can be challenging to maintain that level of excellence and reputation. The idiom is often used to caution against complacency and to encourage individuals to continue striving for excellence, even after achieving success.

Therefore, the literal translation of the idiom is ""do one's best and for,"" which implies taking action and making an effort towards a goal or objective.  Example: ""尽管很困难，我还是尽力而为，希望能成功。"" (Despite the difficulty, I still do my best and for, hoping to succeed.)

Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where something good happens once, but it is unlikely to happen again. The word ""双"" (shuāng) means ""double"" and ""至"" (zhì) means ""to reach"" or ""to occur"". Therefore, the idiom ""福无双至"" literally means ""good fortune has no double occurrence"".

The idiom is often used in the following sentence: ""The company's stock price has risen sharply, but it's unlikely to continue like this, as the saying goes, '福无双至'.""  In this sentence, the idiom is used to suggest that the company's good fortune is unlikely to last, and that a downturn is inevitable.  The idiom can also be used in other contexts, such as in personal relationships or in business. For example, ""After getting married, the couple's love for each other was at its peak, but as the saying goes, '福无双至', their love eventually faded.""  In this sentence, the idiom is used to suggest that the couple's happiness was short-lived, and that their love eventually declined.  Overall, the idiom ""福无双至"" is a reminder that good fortune is fleeting and that we should appreciate it while it lasts.  It is a common idiom in Chinese culture and is often used in everyday conversation.  The idiom has a long history and is mentioned in several classic Chinese texts, including the ""Book of Poetry"" and the ""Analects of Confucius"".  It is a testament to the wisdom and insight of ancient Chinese thinkers who understood the fleeting nature of good fortune.  The idiom has been passed down through generations and continues to be used today, serving as a reminder of the importance of appreciating good fortune while it lasts.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""福无双至"" also has a deeper meaning.  It suggests that good fortune is not something that can be taken for granted, and that we should be grateful for what we have while it lasts.

耳闻不如目见,Seeing for oneself is better than hearing from others,Hearing is worse than seeing,"One hears not like one sees. Answer: One hears not like one sees. Explanation: This idiom is used to convey that seeing something with one's own eyes is more convincing than hearing about it from others. It means that direct observation is more reliable than hearsay. The idiom is composed of two characters: ""耳闻"" (one hears) and ""目见"" (one sees). The first part ""耳闻"" means to hear something from others, while the second part ""目见"" means to see something with one's own eyes. The idiom is a reminder that seeing is believing, and that direct experience is more valuable than second-hand information. The literal translation of the idiom is ""one hears not like one sees,"" which emphasizes the difference between hearing and seeing. It suggests that hearing about something is not as reliable as seeing it with one's own eyes. Example sentence: ""I don't believe the rumors about the new restaurant until I see it with my own eyes."" (我不相信那家餐厅的传闻，直到我亲眼见到它。) In this example, the speaker is emphasizing the importance of direct observation and experience, rather than relying on hearsay or rumors. The idiom is often used in situations where people are skeptical or unsure about something, and want to verify the information through their own senses.  The idiom is also used in a more general sense to emphasize the importance of direct experience and observation, rather than relying on second-hand information. For example: ""I learned more about the city by walking around it than by reading about it in a book."" (我通过走遍城市才真正了解它，而不是通过读书。) In this example, the speaker is emphasizing the value of direct experience and observation, rather than relying on second-hand information. The idiom is a reminder that seeing is believing, and that direct experience is more valuable than second-hand information.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including education, business, and everyday life. It is a useful phrase to keep in mind when evaluating information and making decisions.  The idiom is also used in a more figurative sense to emphasize the importance of direct experience and observation in understanding complex issues or concepts. For example: ""To truly understand the impact of climate change, one needs to see it with their own eyes, rather than just hearing about it."" (要真正了解气候变化的影响，需要亲眼见到，而不是仅仅听"

落花有意，流水无情,Unrequited love,"Falling flowers are intentional, flowing water is ruthless","The storm will come regardless of our efforts to prevent it. Answer: Falling flowers have intention, flowing water has no emotion.  In this case, the translation is not entirely faithful to the original idiom, as it doesn't convey the nuance of the word ""无情"" (wú qíng), which implies a lack of emotional attachment or indifference. A more literal translation would be ""Falling flowers have intention, flowing water has no feeling."" However, the common translation ""Falling flowers have intention, flowing water has no heart"" is more idiomatic and conveys the same meaning.  The idiom is used to describe someone who is emotionally attached to something that is fleeting or ephemeral, like a falling flower, while another person is indifferent or unfeeling, like flowing water.  The idiom suggests that the person who is emotionally attached is like the falling flower, which has intention or purpose, but is ultimately unable to control its fate, while the person who is indifferent is like the flowing water, which has no feeling or emotional attachment.  The idiom is often used to describe a romantic relationship where one person is deeply invested, while the other person is not as emotionally attached.  In this sense, the idiom is often used to caution against investing too much emotional energy in a relationship that may not be reciprocated.  The idiom can also be used more broadly to describe situations where someone is overly attached to something that is fleeting or ephemeral, such as a hobby, a goal, or a material possession.  In this sense, the idiom is often used to encourage people to let go of their attachments and live in the present moment.  Overall, the idiom ""落花有意，流水无情"" is a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of life and the importance of being present and mindful in the moment.  It encourages people to cultivate a sense of detachment and acceptance, and to let go of their emotional attachments to things that are beyond their control.  The idiom is a powerful reminder of the impermanence of all things, and the importance of living in the present moment.  It is a timeless and universal message that transcends cultures and languages, and continues to resonate with people around the world.  The idiom has been used in various forms of Chinese literature and art throughout history, and continues to be a popular phrase in modern Chinese culture.  It is often used in poetry, literature, and music to convey the themes of impermanence"
