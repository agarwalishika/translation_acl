举一反三,Infer other things from one fact,Learn by analogy,"Raise one, counter three. The final answer is: Raise one, counter three.  Explanation: This idiom is used to describe the act of using one example to illustrate or counter three different points. It is often used in a rhetorical or persuasive context to make a point or to argue a case. The idiom is thought to have originated from the idea of using a single example to counter three different arguments or perspectives.  Example sentence: ""The professor used the example of the Great Wall to illustrate the concept of national unity, but in reality, it was just a case of 举一反三.""  In this sentence, the professor is accused of using a single example to make a point that applies to three different situations, rather than providing a more nuanced or detailed explanation.  Note: The idiom can also be translated as ""to use one example to counter three"" or ""to use one case to illustrate three"", but the most common translation is ""to raise one, counter three"".

远水不救近火,Water far away is not of much use in putting out a fire,Far water does not save near fire,"Distant water does not save near fire. Answer: Distant water does not save near fire. Explanation: This idiom means that a solution or help that is far away or difficult to obtain is not useful in solving a problem that is close at hand or easily accessible. Example: ""The company's financial troubles are caused by its own mismanagement, so it's no use looking for a bailout from a foreign investor."" In this example, the company's financial troubles are a ""near fire"" that cannot be put out by a ""distant water"" (the foreign investor's bailout). The idiom is often used to caution against relying on external solutions or help when the problem can be solved internally. It is also used to emphasize the importance of self-reliance and taking responsibility for one's own problems. The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that seeking external help is a sign of weakness or lack of self-reliance. However, it can also be used in a positive sense, implying that a solution should come from within and that external help should be a last resort. In either case, the idiom is a reminder that true strength and resilience come from within. The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal relationships.

骨鲠在喉,Have an opinion one cannot suppress,Bone stuck in throat,"A bone stuck in the throat. Answer: She always felt like there was a bone stuck in her throat, and she always felt like she had done something wrong. Explanation: The idiom ""骨鲠在喉"" literally means ""a bone stuck in the throat."" It is used to describe a feeling of unease or discomfort that lingers, often without a clear reason or explanation. The idiom suggests that the bone (the unease) is stuck in the throat, causing discomfort and making it difficult to speak or swallow. This idiom is often used to convey a sense of guilt, regret, or anxiety that is hard to shake off. Example sentence: 她一直觉得有个骨鲠在喉，总觉得自己做错了什么。 (She always felt like there was a bone stuck in her throat, and she always felt like she had done something wrong.) Note: This idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, rather than a literal one. It is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a way to describe a feeling or emotional state.
