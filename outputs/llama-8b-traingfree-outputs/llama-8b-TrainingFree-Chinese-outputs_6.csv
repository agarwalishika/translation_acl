认贼作父,Treat a thief as one's father,Recognize a thief as a father,"To treat a traitor as a father.  Explanation: This idiom means to be overly fond of or overly attached to someone who has betrayed you, often to the point of being forgiving or lenient towards them. It describes a person who prioritizes their emotional connection with the traitor over their own sense of justice or self-worth.  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is being overly forgiving or naive about someone who has betrayed them.  For example, ""After he cheated me out of all my money, I still invited him to dinner and treated him like family. My friends said I was recognizing the thief as my father.""  The idiom is thought to have originated from a story in the classic Chinese novel ""The Water Margin"" where a character is forced to recognize a thief as his father in order to save his own life.  The story is often used to illustrate the theme of the idiom, which is that sometimes people are willing to forgive and forget in order to avoid conflict or trouble.  However, the idiom is also often used to criticize people who are overly forgiving or naive, and to caution against being too quick to forgive those who have wronged us.  In modern times, the idiom is often used in a more humorous or ironic way to describe situations where someone is being overly forgiving or naive, such as when a person is still friends with someone who has cheated on them or betrayed their trust.  Overall, the idiom ""to treat a traitor as a father"" is a common expression in Chinese culture that is used to convey a sense of foolishness or naivety in the face of betrayal.  It is often used to caution against being too quick to forgive those who have wronged us, and to encourage people to stand up for themselves and assert their rights.

飞蛾投火,A seeking one's own doom,Moth to fire,"Literal: Translation: _______  Answer:  Fly moth throws fire  Explanation: The idiom ""飞蛾投火"" literally means ""fly moth throws fire"". It is a metaphorical expression that describes someone who takes risks or makes sacrifices for the benefit of others, often without considering their own safety or well-being. The phrase is derived from the idea that a moth flying towards a flame is a selfless act, as the moth is aware of the danger but chooses to take the risk anyway. In a broader sense, the idiom can be used to describe someone who is willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good, even if it means putting themselves in harm's way. Example sentence: ""他飞蛾投火地帮助了困难的朋友，赢得了大家的尊敬。"" (He threw himself into helping his difficult friend, earning everyone's respect.)  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to describe the person's selfless act of helping their friend, even if it meant putting themselves in a difficult situation. The phrase is often used to express admiration or appreciation for someone's willingness to take risks for the benefit of others.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any other questions.
