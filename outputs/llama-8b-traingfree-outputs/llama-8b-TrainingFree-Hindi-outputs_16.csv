मुँह में ज़ुबान नहीं,to be timid or silent,no tongue in the mouth,"There is no tongue in one's mouth. Answer: There is no tongue in one's mouth. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who talks a lot but has nothing meaningful to say.

This idiom is often used to convey that someone is just making noise without any substance or value. The literal translation ""There is no tongue in one's mouth"" is a direct and faithful representation of the idiom, without any commentary or interpretation. The answer is a direct translation of the idiom, without any additional explanation or context. The explanation provides a brief background on the idiom and its usage, but the answer remains a simple and direct translation.
