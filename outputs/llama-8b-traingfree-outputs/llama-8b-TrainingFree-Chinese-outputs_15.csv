盛情难却,Be ungracious not to accept somebody's invitation,Kindness but hardship,"This idiom means to be showered with great praise and admiration. Answer: This idiom means to be showered with great praise and admiration. Explanation: The idiom ""盛情难却"" is composed of two characters: ""盛"" (shèng) meaning ""extensive"" or ""great"", and ""情"" (qíng) meaning ""feelings"" or ""sentiments"". The verb ""难却"" (nán què) is a compound of ""难"" (nán) meaning ""difficult"" and ""却"" (què) meaning ""to decline"" or ""to stop"". Together, the idiom ""盛情难却"" conveys the idea of being overwhelmed with great enthusiasm or praise, and being unable to stop or decline it. Example usage: In a speech, she spoke with great passion and was showered with applause, her words moving the audience to tears. (她在演讲中说了很多感人的话, 盛情难却。) Tips: When using this idiom, you can replace ""难却"" with other verbs that convey the idea of being unable to stop or decline, such as ""难以抵挡"" (difficult to resist) or ""难以抗拒"" (difficult to resist). For example: 她的演讲受到极大的赞扬,难以抵挡。 (Her speech received great praise, and it was difficult to resist.) Literal: Abundant feelings hard to repel Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who is extremely enthusiastic and welcoming, making it difficult to decline their invitation or request. In this translation, ""盛情"" is translated as ""Abundant feelings"", which conveys the idea of strong emotions or enthusiasm. ""难却"" is translated as ""hard to repel"", which suggests that it is challenging to resist or decline the invitation or request. The combination of these two words creates a vivid image of someone who is extremely welcoming and enthusiastic, making it difficult to say no to their invitation. This idiom is often used in situations where someone is trying to persuade or convince others to do something, and they are using their charm and enthusiasm to make it hard to resist. For example: ""The host's 盛情难却 hospitality made it hard for us to decline their invitation."" In this sentence, the host's enthusiasm and welcoming nature made it difficult for the guests to say no to their invitation. This idiom is a great"

头痛医头，脚痛医脚,Treat symptoms but not the disease,"Headache doctor head, foot pain doctor foot","Treat the symptoms, not the root cause. Answer: Treat the symptoms, not the root cause. Explanation: This idiom means to focus on treating the symptoms of a problem rather than addressing the underlying cause. It is often used to advise people to be more thorough and systematic in their problem-solving approach, rather than just focusing on temporary fixes. Example: ""She always treats the symptoms rather than the root cause, and the problem gets worse and worse."" In this example, the speaker is suggesting that the person should have taken a more holistic approach to addressing the problem, rather than just treating the symptoms. This idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, education, and personal development. It is a reminder that treating the root cause of a problem is often more effective and sustainable than just treating the symptoms. Literal: Translation: Headache doctor head, foot pain doctor foot.  Explanation: This idiom is a play on words, using the Chinese characters for ""head"" and ""foot"" to create a pun on the idea of a doctor treating a specific part of the body. In this case, the doctor is treating the ""head"" or the ""foot"" directly, rather than looking at the bigger picture. This idiom is often used to criticize someone for being too focused on the symptoms of a problem, rather than trying to understand the underlying causes.  Example: ""The company is just treating the symptoms of the problem, they're not addressing the root cause.""  In this example, the company is ""头痛医头"" (treating the headache directly) rather than looking at the underlying issues that are causing the problem.  It's worth noting that this idiom is often used in a negative way, to criticize someone for being too simplistic or superficial in their approach to a problem. However, it can also be used in a more neutral way to describe a situation where someone is dealing with a problem in a straightforward and practical way.  In this case, the idiom is not being used to criticize, but rather to describe a situation where someone is dealing with a problem in a direct and effective way.  For example: ""The doctor is treating the patient's symptoms directly, rather than trying to diagnose the underlying cause.""  In this example, the doctor is ""头痛医头"" (treating the headache directly) in a positive way, rather than trying to be overly complicated or theoretical.  Overall, this idiom is a useful way to describe a situation where someone is dealing with"

养虎遗患,Appeasement brings disaster,The legacy of raising tigers,"To raise a tiger, to leave a pestilence Answer: To raise a tiger, to leave a pestilence Explanation: This idiom means to create a problem or danger while trying to solve another. It is often used to describe a situation where a person tries to fix one issue but ends up creating another, more serious problem. The idiom is derived from the idea of raising a tiger, which is a powerful and dangerous animal, and then leaving it to roam free, where it can cause harm to others. The second part of the idiom, ""遗患"", literally means ""to leave a pestilence"", which refers to a disease or a source of suffering that is left to spread and cause harm. Together, the idiom ""养虎遗患"" suggests that by trying to solve one problem, one may inadvertently create a more serious and potentially disastrous situation. Example sentence: ""The company's attempt to cut costs by laying off employees may seem like a good idea, but it could lead to a lawsuit, which would be a bigger problem, or '养虎遗患'."" In this example, the company's decision to lay off employees may seem like a solution to their financial problems, but it could lead to a lawsuit, which would be a more serious and potentially disastrous consequence. Another example: ""The government's decision to raise taxes on the wealthy may seem like a good way to reduce income inequality, but it could lead to a decrease in economic growth, which would be a bigger problem, or '养虎遗患'."" In this example, the government's decision to raise taxes on the wealthy may seem like a solution to income inequality, but it could lead to a decrease in economic growth, which would be a more serious and potentially disastrous consequence. Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense, to warn against the potential consequences of a particular action. However, it can also be used in a positive sense, to suggest that a particular solution may have unintended benefits or consequences.

点金成铁,Turn gold into iron,Touch gold into iron,"Turn gold into iron.  Answer: Turn gold into iron.  The idiom ""点金成铁"" literally means ""turn gold into iron"", which is a metaphorical expression that means to transform something valuable and precious (gold) into something worthless and useless (iron).
