Explanation: The idiom ""旧恨新仇"" (jiù hèn xīn chóu) is a combination of two Chinese characters: ""jiù"" meaning ""old"" or ""long-standing"", ""hèn"" meaning ""hate"" or ""resentment"", ""xīn"" meaning ""new"" or ""recent"", and ""chóu"" meaning ""vengeance"" or ""revenge"". The idiom is often used to describe someone who has been holding onto a grudge for a long time and is waiting for the perfect opportunity to seek revenge. The ""jiù"" in the idiom emphasizes the long-standing nature of the resentment, while the ""xīn"" suggests that the person is still seeking revenge even after a long time has passed. In the example sentence, the phrase ""怀恨在心"" (huái hèn zài xīn) means ""to harbor resentment in one's heart"", which is a common expression used to describe someone who is nursing a grudge. The phrase ""等到对方犯错"" (děng dào duì fāng fàn cuò) means ""to wait for the other person to make a mistake"", which is a common way to describe the opportunity for revenge. The phrase ""就报复了"" (jiù bào fù le) means ""to take revenge immediately"", which is a common way to describe the act of seeking revenge. Overall, the idiom ""旧恨新仇"" suggests a deep-seated resentment and a desire for revenge that can simmer for years, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. It is often used to describe someone who is vengeful and seeks revenge at the slightest opportunity, often after a long period of time has passed. The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including politics, business, and personal relationships, to describe situations where there are multiple layers of conflict and resentment. The phrase is often used to convey a sense of complexity and depth in the conflict, and to suggest that simply addressing one issue may not be enough to resolve the underlying tensions. In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used figuratively to describe a situation where there are multiple sources of conflict and tension, and where a single solution may not be enough to address the underlying issues. The idiom is often"

行若无事,Behave as if nothing had happened,Act like nothing,"Proceed as if nothing is happening.  Answer:  Proceed as if nothing is happening.  Explanation:  This idiom is used to describe someone who acts as if nothing is wrong or nothing has happened, often in a situation where there is a problem or a crisis.

It's a way of saying ""I'm not bothered"" or ""I'm not concerned"" without directly addressing the issue.  In some cases, the idiom can also be used to describe someone who is in denial or refusing to acknowledge a problem.  For example, if someone is struggling with addiction, they might say ""行若无事"" to suggest that they're not aware of the severity of their addiction or that they're not going to let it affect their life.

In this example, the speaker is pointing out the contradiction between the person's words and actions, suggesting that their behavior is not consistent with their verbal claims.  This idiom can also be translated as ""Actions speak louder than words.""  However, the original Chinese phrase is more concise and idiomatic.

This idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including education, parenting, and leadership.

For example:  ""You claim to be a responsible leader, but your body teaches better than your words.  You always put your own interests ahead of the team's needs.""  In this example, the speaker is pointing out the discrepancy between the person's words and actions, suggesting that their behavior is not consistent with their verbal claims.  This idiom can also be used to encourage people to be more mindful of their behavior and to strive for consistency between their words and actions.  For example:  ""Remember, your body teaches better than your words.  Always be mindful of your actions and make sure they align with your values and principles.""  In this example, the speaker is encouraging the person to"
