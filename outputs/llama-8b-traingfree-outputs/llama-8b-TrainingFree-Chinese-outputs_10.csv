混淆是非,Confuse (or confound) right and wrong,Confusing right and wrong,"The final answer is: 混淆是非。 The final answer is: 混淆是非。 Answer: Confusion is distinction  Explanation: This idiom is often used to describe a situation where things are not clear-cut, and it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong. The literal translation is ""confusion is distinction"", which may seem counterintuitive, but it highlights the complexity of the situation. The word "" 混淆"" (hùn fǔ) means ""confusion"" or ""mixing up"", and "" 是非"" (shì fēi) means ""distinction"" or ""right and wrong"". The idiom suggests that in a state of confusion, the usual distinctions between right and wrong become blurred.  Example sentence: 在混淆是非的情况下，很难做出正确的决定。 (In a situation of confusion is distinction, it's hard to make the right decision.)  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense to describe a situation where people are unclear about what is right and wrong, and may make mistakes as a result. However, it can also be used in a more neutral sense to describe a situation where things are complex and require careful consideration.

烈火见真金,True blue will never stain,Fire sees real gold,"Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer:  Fiery flames see true gold.  Explanation: This idiom means to reveal one's true character or intentions in a moment of crisis or under intense pressure. The ""fiery flames"" represent the challenging situation, and ""true gold"" represents one's genuine nature. When the flames are intense, the gold is revealed.  Example: ""Only when the company faced financial difficulties did the true intentions of the CEO become clear, and it was then that we saw the real him.""  In this example, the ""fiery flames"" are the financial difficulties, and the ""true gold"" is the CEO's true intentions.  This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone's true character is revealed, often in a negative light.  It can also be used to describe a situation where someone's intentions are revealed to be different from what they initially seemed.  The idiom can be used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal relationships.  It is a common idiom in Chinese culture and is often used in everyday conversation.  The idiom is thought to have originated from the idea that when gold is heated in a fire, its true nature is revealed.  In the same way, when someone is faced with a challenging situation, their true character is revealed.  The idiom is often used to caution people to be careful of their actions and intentions, as they may be revealed in a moment of crisis.  It is also used to encourage people to be honest and authentic, as their true nature will eventually be revealed.  The idiom is a reminder that actions have consequences, and that people should strive to be honest and authentic in all their interactions.  It is a valuable lesson in Chinese culture and is often used to teach people about the importance of integrity and authenticity.  The idiom is also used to describe a situation where someone's true intentions are revealed to be different from what they initially seemed.  For example, someone may claim to be a friend, but when faced with a difficult situation, their true intentions are revealed to be self-serving.  In this case, the idiom is used to describe the situation where the person's true nature is revealed, and it is often used to caution people to be careful of their actions and intentions.  The idiom is a common way to describe a situation where someone's true character is revealed, and it is often used in everyday conversation.  It is a valuable lesson in"

无缘无故,For no reason at all,For no reason,"Without relation without reason  Note: ""无缘"" means ""without relation"" and ""无故"" means ""without reason"". Together, they convey the idea of something happening without any apparent cause or connection.  In English, this idiom is often translated as ""out of the blue"" or ""for no reason at all"".  However, the word-for-word translation is ""Without relation without reason"".  Example: ""他突然决定离开公司，完全无缘无故。"" (He suddenly decided to leave the company, completely without reason or relation.)  In this example, the speaker is suggesting that the decision to leave the company was unexpected and unexplained.  The idiom is used to convey that something happened without any apparent cause or connection.  The word ""无缘"" emphasizes that there was no prior relationship or connection between the person and the company, and the word ""无故"" emphasizes that there was no apparent reason for the decision.  Together, they convey a sense of unexpectedness and lack of explanation.  This idiom is often used in situations where someone does something unexpected or unexplained, such as quitting a job or ending a relationship.

自讨苦吃,Do something which will only cause trouble to oneself,Asking for trouble,"To eat bitterness that one has invited upon oneself.  Explanation: This idiom means to suffer the consequences of one's own actions. It is often used to describe a situation where someone is facing problems or difficulties that they have brought upon themselves. The phrase ""自讨苦吃"" is a combination of two Chinese characters: ""自"" (zì) meaning ""oneself"", ""讨"" (tǎo) meaning ""to invite"" or ""to seek out"", ""苦"" (kǔ) meaning ""bitterness"" or ""suffering"", and ""吃"" (chī) meaning ""to eat"".  The phrase is thought to have originated from the idea of inviting guests to come and eat at one's own table, and then being forced to serve them. In this sense, the person is ""eating"" the bitterness that they have invited upon themselves.  This idiom is often used to caution people against making reckless or impulsive decisions that may lead to negative consequences.  For example: ""他不小心把电器泡在水里了，自讨苦吃了。"" (He accidentally put the electric appliance in the water, and now he's suffering the consequences.)  In this example, the person is facing problems that he has brought upon himself, and is therefore ""eating bitterness that he has invited upon himself"".  This idiom is a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that we must be mindful of the potential outcomes before making decisions.  It is a common expression in Chinese culture and is often used in everyday conversation.  The phrase is also used in a more figurative sense to describe situations where someone is facing difficulties or challenges that they have created for themselves.  For example: ""他总是说谎，最后自讨苦吃了。"" (He always lies, and now he's suffering the consequences.)  In this example, the person is facing problems that he has created for himself through his own actions, and is therefore ""eating bitterness that he has invited upon himself"".  This idiom is a reminder that honesty is always the best policy, and that lying or engaging in other forms of dishonest behavior can lead to negative consequences.  It is a valuable lesson that can be applied to many areas of life.  The phrase is also used in a more abstract sense to describe situations where someone is facing challenges or difficulties that they have brought upon themselves through their own thoughts or emotions.  For example: ""他总是担心，最后"

It is often used to describe someone who remains steadfast in their beliefs or values, even in the face of adversity or opposition.

Note: The idiom can also be translated as ""unchanging until death"" or ""unchanging to the end of life"", but the double negative ""does not change"" is a more common and idiomatic translation. The word ""至"" (until) is a key component of the idiom, as it implies a sense of duration or persistence. The word ""死"" (death) is also important, as it serves as a marker for the end of life and the ultimate test of one's commitment. The word ""不变"" (does not change) is the core of the idiom, conveying a sense of unyielding stability and consistency. Overall, the idiom ""至死不变"" is a powerful expression of commitment and loyalty, and is often used to describe individuals who embody these qualities. In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used figuratively to describe a situation or a principle that remains unchanged despite external circumstances. For example: ""The company's mission statement has remained unchanged since its founding, a testament to its enduring values."" In this sentence, the idiom is used to describe the company's commitment to its values, even in the face of changing market conditions or external pressures. The idiom can also be used to describe a person's character or personality, as in: ""She is a person who remains unchanged despite the challenges she faces, a true example of strength and resilience."" In this sentence, the idiom is used to describe the person's unyielding nature, which is a key aspect of their character.
