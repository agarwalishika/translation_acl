落花有意，流水无情,Unrequited love,"Falling flowers are intentional, flowing water is ruthless","It's meant to be. Answer: It's meant to be. Explanation: Falling flowers have intentions, flowing water has no emotions. This idiom means that some things in life are inevitable and cannot be changed, no matter how much one wishes or tries to control them. It is often used to describe situations where one is powerless to stop something from happening. In this sentence, the speaker is resigned to the fact that their parents will not change their minds, and therefore decides to go on the trip despite their disagreement. The tone of this idiom is neutral, with a hint of resignation or acceptance. It is often used in everyday conversation to convey a sense of resignation or acceptance in the face of an inevitable situation. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as when someone is trying to persuade someone to do something that they are reluctant to do, or when someone is trying to come to terms with a difficult situation. Other idioms that convey a sense of resignation or acceptance include “水到渠成” (water flowing into a canal), which means that something will happen inevitably, and “天有不测风云” (the heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds), which means that unexpected things can happen. This idiom is a reflection of the Chinese cultural emphasis on acceptance and resignation in the face of adversity. It is often used to convey a sense of humility and acceptance. The idiom is a play on words, using the contrast between the intentional, deliberate actions of falling flowers (which are often associated with romantic love) and the inevitable, unstoppable flow of water to convey the idea that some things are beyond one's control. The idiom is often used in conjunction with other idioms or phrases to convey a sense of resignation or acceptance. There are no common variations of this idiom. The pronunciation of this idiom is lòu huā yǒu yì, liú shuǐ wú qíng. The characters for this idiom are 落花有意 流水无情.

This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is being hurt or hindered by someone else's actions, even if those actions are not necessarily malicious.

This idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, to describe a situation where someone or something is being harmed or hindered by external circumstances.

Explanation: The idiom 蚍蜉撼树 (jiǎo bān huàn shù) refers to a situation where a small or insignificant force or action can have a significant impact or effect.

视而不见，听而不闻,"Look at but not pay attention to, listen to but hear nothing","Turn a blind eye, hear without hearing","See-but-not-see, hear-but-not-hear. 2. Provide a **natural English idiomatic translation** for the given idiom. - Prioritize clarity and naturalness over literalness. - No extra commentary. Idiom: 视而不见，听而不闻 Translation: _______ Answer: Turn a blind eye to. Explanation: This idiom is a play on words, using the Chinese characters for ""see"" and ""hear"" to create a phrase that means ""to be aware of something but refuse to acknowledge it"" or ""to pretend not to notice something"". The phrase is often used to describe someone who is in denial or refuses to accept the truth. In the translation, I've kept the word order and structure of the original phrase, using ""see-but-not-see"" and ""hear-but-not-hear"" to convey the same meaning as the Chinese idiom. This literal translation helps to preserve the nuance and connotation of the original phrase. Example: ""He's been acting strangely, but his family is still in denial, saying '视而不见，听而不闻'."" (He's been acting strangely, but his family is still in denial, saying ""see-but-not-see, hear-but-not-hear"".)  In this example, the idiom is used to describe the family's refusal to acknowledge their son's strange behavior, even though they are aware of it.  Note: The idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, to describe a situation where someone is in denial or refuses to accept the truth, rather than a literal situation where they are physically seeing or hearing something.

视为知己,Regard as a good friend,Regarded as a confidant,"Literal: Translation: to take as a friend  Explanation: 视 (shì) = to take as; 为 (wèi) = as; 知 (zhī) = friend; 佳 (jiā) = excellent.

面目可憎，语言无味,Repulsive in appearance and flavorless in verbal expression,"Disgusting face, tasteless language","The final answer is: Someone or something that is completely unimpressive or uninteresting. Literal: A face that is loathsome, language that is tasteless. Answer: A face that is loathsome, language that is tasteless. Explanation: The Chinese idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"" is a combination of two phrases: ""面目可憎"" and ""语言无味"". ""面目可憎"" literally means ""a face that is loathsome"" or ""a countenance that is detestable"". ""语言无味"" literally means ""language that is tasteless"". Together, the idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"" describes someone whose appearance is unappealing and whose words are dull and uninteresting. This idiom is often used to describe someone who is unattractive and uncharismatic, as well as someone who is boring and unengaging in conversation. For example, if someone says, ""他面目可憎，语言无味"" (He has a loathsome face and tasteless language), it means that he is unattractive and boring to talk to. In this sense, the idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"" is often used to express disapproval or disappointment with someone's appearance or conversation style. Overall, the idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"" is a vivid and evocative way to describe someone who is unappealing and uninteresting. It's worth noting that the idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"" is not commonly used in modern Chinese, and it may sound a bit old-fashioned or formal. However, it's still a useful idiom to know, especially if you're interested in learning about Chinese culture and language. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Here are some example sentences using the idiom ""面目可憎，语言无味"": * 他面目可憎，语言无味，根本不值得和他交往。 (He has a loathsome face and tasteless language, and it's not worth talking to him.) * 她面目可憎，语言无味，根本不适合做演员。 (She has a loathsome face and tasteless language, and she's not suitable for acting.) * 他面目可憎，语言无味，根本不值"

The phrase ""advancing cloud"" suggests a natural flow or movement that is being suppressed or stifled.  This translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding than a literal word-for-word translation.  I hope this helps!  -Jiang"
