सीने में जलन होना,to feel envy,to have burning in the chest,"I feel a burning sense of injustice in my heart. Answer: I feel a burning sense of injustice in my heart.  (Note: This is a more idiomatic translation, and conveys the same emotional state as the original idiom.)  The idiom सीने में जलन होना is often used to describe a feeling of outrage or indignation when someone is treated unfairly or unjustly.  For example: ""मुझे सुना कि किसी को न्यायालय में झूठा फंसाया गया है, मुझे सीने में जलन हो रही है"" (Mujhe sunā ki kisī ko nyāyālay meṃ jhūṭhā phaṃsāya gayā hai, mujhe sīne meṃ jalana hō rahī hai) which translates to ""I heard that someone was falsely accused in court, and I feel a burning sense of injustice in my heart.""  The idiom is often used to express a strong emotional response to a situation, and is often used in a more dramatic or emphatic way.  Therefore, while the literal translation of the idiom is ""in the chest to burn to be"", the idiomatic translation is more nuanced and conveys a deeper meaning.  The idiom सीने में जलन होना is often used in Hindi and other Indian languages, and is not typically used in English.  However, the concept of feeling a burning sensation in the chest is a universal human experience, and the idiom has been translated into English as ""to feel a burning sense of injustice in my heart"".  This translation conveys the same emotional state as the original idiom, but uses more common English phrases to describe the feeling.  The idiomatic translation is more natural and clear, and is more likely to be used in everyday conversation.  Therefore, the idiomatic translation ""I feel a burning sense of injustice in my heart"" is a more suitable translation of the idiom सीने में जलन होना.  The idiom सीने में जलन होना is often used to describe a feeling of outrage or indignation when someone is treated unfairly or unjustly.  For example: ""मुझे सुना कि किसी को न्यायालय में झूठा फंसाया गया है, म"

अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत,too much of anything is bad,excess should be avoided everywhere,"Excessive everywhere must be avoided. Excessive also not reach.  Answer Key: The idiom means ""excessive is bad everywhere"" or ""don't overdo it."" The literal translation is a bit awkward, but it conveys the idea that excessive behavior is undesirable everywhere. The Chinese idiom uses the word ""过犹不及"" which is a more idiomatic expression that conveys the same meaning. The word ""过犹不及"" is a combination of two characters: ""过"" means excessive, ""犹"" means also, ""不"" means not, and ""及"" means reach or attain. The phrase is saying that if you go too far, you will not reach the desired result. The idiom is often used to advise people not to overdo things, as excessive behavior can lead to negative consequences. The Sanskrit idiom ""अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत्"" is a more literal translation of the idea, but it uses the word ""अति"" which means excessive, ""सर्वत्र"" which means everywhere, and ""वर्जयेत्"" which means must be avoided. The phrase is saying that excessive behavior must be avoided everywhere. Both idioms convey the same message, but the Chinese idiom is more idiomatic and easier to remember."
