瞎子摸鱼,Act blindly,Blind man fishing,Literal: Translation:
瞎子点灯白费蜡,Absolutely useless,The blind man lights the lamp in vain,A futile effort or a waste of resources.
瞎子见钱眼睛开,"On seeing money, even a blind man would have his eyes wide open",The blind man sees money and his eyes open,"Blind person see money eyes open  This idiom means that anyone can be tempted by money, even the most naive or foolish person.  Example sentence: ""He's so naive, but once he sees the money, his eyes are open.""  (He's so naive, but once he sees the money, his eyes open.)  Note: This idiom is a play on words, using the fact that a blind person's eyes are already ""closed"" (i.e., they can't see) to contrast with the idea that even a blind person would be tempted by money.  The word ""open"" (, kāi) has a double meaning here, referring both to the physical state of the eyes and the idea of being open to temptation.  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is easily swayed by material gain or who is naive about the ways of the world.  In the example sentence, the speaker is saying that even someone as naive as the person being addressed would be tempted by money.  The tone is often sarcastic or ironic, implying that the person being addressed is not as naive as they seem.  The idiom can also be used more broadly to describe a situation where someone is tempted by money or material gain, even if they are not typically naive or foolish.  For example: ""The politician's eyes opened when he saw the bribe money.""  (The politician's eyes open when he sees the bribe money.)  In this case, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone is tempted by money, but it's not necessarily a commentary on their naivety or foolishness.  The tone can vary depending on the context and the speaker's intentions.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to highlight the power of money to tempt even the most unlikely person.  It's a common idiom in Chinese culture and is often used in everyday conversation.  It's worth noting that the idiom is not necessarily meant to be taken literally, and it's not suggesting that a blind person would actually be able to see money.  Rather, it's a figurative expression used to describe a situation where someone is tempted by money.  The idiom is often used in a way that's similar to the English idiom ""money talks,"" but with a more nuanced and complex meaning.  The idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is"

破旧立新,Destroy the old and establish the new,Break the old and build the new,"Break old establish new.  Explanation: This idiom is used to describe the process of replacing old things with new ones, often in a context of renovation or reform. The phrase is composed of two characters: 破 (pò) meaning ""break"" or ""destroy"", and 立 (lì) meaning ""establish"" or ""set up"". Together, they convey the idea of dismantling the old and building the new. The idiom is often used to describe a complete overhaul or a radical change, rather than a gradual or incremental one.  Example: ""The new management team decided to break old habits and establish new ones to improve efficiency.""  In this example, the idiom is used to describe a deliberate effort to replace outdated practices with more effective ones.  Another example: ""The city's old infrastructure was in disrepair, so the government decided to break old roads and establish new ones to improve traffic flow.""  In this example, the idiom is used to describe a large-scale renovation project that involves replacing old infrastructure with new one.  In both examples, the idiom is used to convey the idea of a complete overhaul or a radical change, rather than a gradual or incremental one.  The idiom can also be used in a more abstract sense, such as: ""The new policy aims to break old mindsets and establish new ones to promote social change.""  In this example, the idiom is used to describe a effort to change people's attitudes or beliefs, rather than just physical infrastructure.  Overall, the idiom is used to convey the idea of replacing old things with new ones, often in a context of renovation or reform.  It is a powerful metaphor that can be applied to a wide range of situations, from physical infrastructure to social attitudes.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

硕果仅存,One of the few still lest,Only fruit remains,"Only the fruit remains, the tree is gone. (or: Only the fruit remains, the tree has perished.)  Explanation: This idiom refers to a situation where the results or achievements of a project or endeavor remain, but the original team or individuals who created them are no longer there. It is often used to describe a situation where the people who initiated a project have left or retired, but the project continues to thrive. The idiom suggests that the ""fruit"" (results) of the project is still present, but the ""tree"" (the original team or individuals) has ""perished"" or disappeared.  Example sentence: ""After the founder left the company, the company's success was like 硕果仅存, the founder's vision and leadership were still guiding the company, but the original team was no longer there.""  Note: This idiom is often used in a positive sense to describe the enduring legacy of a project or individual, but it can also be used in a negative sense to describe the loss of a team or individual who was essential to a project's success.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Xueying Li (2019)  Note: The idiom is composed of two characters: 硕果 (shuò guǒ) meaning ""fruit"" and 仅存 (jǐn cún) meaning ""only remains"".  Answer: Only the fruit remains, the tree is gone. (or: Only the fruit remains, the tree has perished.)

祸不单行,It never rains but it pours,Misfortunes never come singly,"Misfortune does not travel alone.  Explanation: This idiom means that when one person suffers misfortune, others are likely to suffer as well.  Example: ""After the factory closed, many families in the neighborhood suffered financially. It's a case of 祸不单行.""  (The factory's closure was a misfortune that did not travel alone.)  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where a single event or circumstance has a ripple effect, causing a chain reaction of problems for those around it.  In this example, the factory's closure had a negative impact on the entire neighborhood, not just the families who worked at the factory.  This idiom is often used to caution people against taking risks or making decisions that could have far-reaching consequences.  It is also used to encourage people to think about the potential impact of their actions on others.  In general, the idiom is used to convey the idea that misfortune is contagious and can spread quickly, affecting many people in its wake.  It is often used in situations where someone is considering taking a risk or making a decision that could have negative consequences for others.  For example, ""If you quit your job without a new one lined up, you'll be putting your family in a difficult situation. That's a case of 祸不单行.""  (Quitting your job without a new one lined up is a misfortune that will not travel alone.)  In this example, the speaker is warning the person that quitting their job without a plan will not only affect them, but also their family, who will have to deal with the consequences of their decision.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, finance, and personal relationships.  It is a reminder that our actions can have a significant impact on those around us, and that we should always consider the potential consequences of our decisions.  In general, the idiom is used to convey the idea that we are all connected and that our individual actions can have a ripple effect on those around us.  It is a powerful reminder of the importance of considering the impact of our actions on others.  The idiom is often used in a cautionary sense, to warn people against taking risks or making decisions that could have negative consequences for others.  For example, ""If you invest all your money in a single stock, you'll be putting your entire financial future at risk. That's a case of 祸不单行.""  (Invest"

胸中有数,Have a good idea of how things stand,Number in chest,"to have a good sense of one's own strengths and weaknesses, and to know how to use them to one's advantage. Answer: to have a good sense of one's own strengths and weaknesses, and to know how to use them to one's advantage.  Explanation: This idiom is often used to describe someone who is self-aware and able to make rational decisions.  Example sentence: ""He is a very confident person, he has numbers in his chest.""

In this example, the speaker is suggesting that she has a clear sense of her own strengths and weaknesses, and is able to use that knowledge to make informed decisions.  The idiom is often used in a positive sense, to describe someone who is self-aware and able to make rational decisions.  However, it can also be used in a negative sense, to describe someone who is overly self-aware and able to manipulate others to their advantage.  For example: ""He has numbers in his chest, he is always trying to manipulate people to get what he wants."" (He is overly self-aware and able to use that knowledge to manipulate others to his advantage.)  In this example, the speaker is suggesting that he is overly self-aware and able to use that knowledge to manipulate others to his advantage.  Overall, the idiom is a useful way to describe someone who is self-aware and able to make rational decisions, and can be used in a variety of contexts.  However, it is worth noting that the idiom can also be used in a negative sense, to describe someone who is overly self-aware and able to manipulate others.

自讨苦吃,Do something which will only cause trouble to oneself,Asking for trouble,"He's inviting disaster by picking a fight with those troublemakers.  Explanation: This translation conveys the idiomatic sense of the phrase, rather than a literal translation.  The idiom ""自讨苦吃"" means to court trouble or to invite disaster, and the translation ""He's inviting disaster by picking a fight with those troublemakers"" captures the sense of recklessness and foolishness that is implied by the idiom.  The use of the word ""inviting"" suggests that the person is deliberately seeking out trouble, rather than simply being in a difficult situation.  This translation is more natural and idiomatic than a literal translation, which might be something like ""He eats his own bitter labor by fighting with those bad people.""  The literal translation is not as clear or concise as the idiomatic translation, and it does not convey the same sense of danger and recklessness.  Overall, the idiomatic translation is a more effective way to convey the meaning of the idiom, and it is more likely to be understood by a native English speaker.  The idiomatic translation is also more concise and natural-sounding than the literal translation, making it a better choice for most purposes.

By using the idiomatic translation, the speaker can tap into this cultural significance and convey a sense of shared understanding and experience.

Explanation: 解 (to untie or open) 囊 (a bag or pouch) 相 (each other) 助 (to help) The idiom literally means ""to help each other out of one's own bag."" It is used to describe people who help each other financially or in other ways.  Example: ""They are good friends and always help each other out of their own pockets.""  (他们是好朋友，总是互相帮助，出自自己的口袋。)  Note: This idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe people who are willing to lend a helping hand, but only if it doesn't cost them anything.  For example: ""He's always willing to help, but only if it doesn't cost him a single penny.""  (他总是愿意帮助别人，但只有当不花一分钱的时候。)  In this sense, the idiom is used to imply that someone is only willing to help if it's convenient or cost-free for them.  This is a common phenomenon in many cultures, where people are more likely to help others if it doesn't require them to spend any money or effort.  In this sense, the idiom is used to highlight the hypocrisy or self-interest of someone who only helps others when it's easy or convenient for them.  It's worth noting that this idiom is not always used in a negative way, and can also be used to describe genuine friendships or helpful relationships where people are willing to lend a hand without expecting anything in return.  However, in many cases, the idiom is used to highlight the limitations or self-interest of someone who only helps others under certain conditions.  Overall, the idiom ""解囊相助"" is a common expression in Chinese culture that highlights the importance of genuine helpfulness and the limitations of self-interest.  It's a reminder that true friendship and helpfulness require a willingness to go beyond one's own interests and help others without expecting anything in return.  In this sense, the idiom is a valuable tool for promoting empathy, kindness, and generosity in our daily lives.  It's a reminder that helping others is not just about what we can gain from it, but about what we can give to others and how we can make a positive impact on their lives.  By using this idiom, we can encourage ourselves and others to be more generous and willing to help others, even if"

身先士卒,Lead one's men in a charge,Lead the way,"The body precedes the soldiers. Answer: The body precedes the soldiers. Explanation: This idiom means to put oneself in harm's way to protect others, often in a leadership role. The word ""body"" (身) refers to the leader, and ""soldiers"" (士卒) refers to the followers. The phrase suggests that the leader is willing to take risks to ensure the safety of their team. In a literal sense, it means that the leader goes first, taking the lead and facing potential dangers before their followers. This idiom is often used to describe a leader who is willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others. Example: The firefighter rushed into the burning building, putting his life at risk to save the trapped family. His actions were a perfect example of ""身先士卒"". In this example, the firefighter is the leader, and the family is the team he is protecting. By rushing into the burning building, he is putting himself in harm's way to save others, demonstrating the spirit of ""身先士卒"". Note: This idiom is often used to describe leaders who are willing to take risks to protect their team, but it can also be used more broadly to describe anyone who puts themselves in harm's way to help others. Variations: There are several variations of this idiom, including: * 身先士卒而不先士卒之身 (The body precedes the soldiers, but not the body of the soldiers) - This variation emphasizes the idea that the leader is willing to take risks, but not to the point of putting their own life in danger. * 身先士卒而不先士卒之心 (The body precedes the soldiers, but not the heart of the soldiers) - This variation suggests that the leader is willing to take risks, but not to the point of sacrificing their own values or principles. These variations are less common than the original idiom, but they can be used to convey different shades of meaning. Synonyms: Some synonyms for this idiom include: * 为人师表 (To be a model for others) - This idiom emphasizes the idea of being a role model and setting a good example for others. * 为他人排难 (To help others in times of need) - This idiom emphasizes the idea of being willing to help others in times of difficulty or crisis. * 为他人着想 (To think of others) - This idiom emphasizes the idea of being willing to put others' needs before"
