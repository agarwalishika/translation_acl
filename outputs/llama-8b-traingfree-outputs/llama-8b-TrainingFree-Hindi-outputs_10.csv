अंधे को हाथ का सहारा,a small help to someone in need,the hand’s support for a blind person,"अंधे को हाथ का सहारा is a Hindi idiom that translates to ""A blind man's helping hand"" in English. It means that even a person who is incompetent or incapable can still provide some assistance or support. The idiom is often used to convey that even the least capable person can offer some help, and it's better than nothing. In this context, the idiom is used to emphasize the importance of any kind of help, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. The correct answer is C) A blind man's helping hand. The other options are incorrect because they either change the meaning of the idiom or add extra words that are not present in the original Hindi phrase. Option A) A blind man's aid is close, but it doesn't convey the same sense of ""helping hand"" as the original idiom. Option B) A helping hand is a general phrase that doesn't specifically refer to a blind person, and option D) A helping hand to the blind is also incorrect because it adds an extra phrase that is not present in the original idiom. Therefore, the correct answer is C) A blind man's helping hand."
