The final answer is: This idiom implies that one only seeks to do good or virtuous things when there is a personal gain or advantage involved. Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer:  Without affairs not enter three treasures hall.  Explanation:  This idiom means to visit someone in a position of authority or power, often with an ulterior motive.  The ""three treasures"" refer to the Buddhist concept of the three treasures of Buddhism: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.  In this context, the ""three treasures hall"" is a metaphor for a place of authority or power.  The idiom suggests that one would not visit such a place without a reason or an ulterior motive.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe someone who visits a high-ranking official or a person of influence, often with a request or a favor in mind.  The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that the visitor is not genuinely interested in the official's well-being, but rather has an ulterior motive.  For example:  ""He went to see the mayor, no doubt with some ulterior motive.""  ""She visited the CEO, but it was just a pretext for her real goal.""  In both cases, the idiom is used to suggest that the visitor's true intention is not what it seems.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is trying to curry favor or gain an advantage through their visit.  For example:  ""He went to see the governor, but it was just a publicity stunt.""  ""She visited the president, but it was just a photo opportunity.""

当局者迷，旁观者清,Those closely involved cannot see as clearly as those outside,"Father, like son","Many people believe that this war is futile because those directly involved are often unable to see the obvious solution, while those who are not directly involved can see it more clearly. Answer: When the local person is confused, the outside observer is clear. Note: This idiom means that people who are directly involved in a situation often can't see the obvious solution, while those who are outside the situation can see it more clearly. Example: ""The company is in a mess, but the CEO is too close to the problem to see a way out. It's the outside consultant who can offer a clear solution."" Source: Chinese Idioms (http://www.chineseidioms.org/idiom/dang-ju-zhe-mi-pang-guan-zhe-qing/) What's the idiom's origin? The idiom ""当局者迷，旁观者清"" is a Chinese proverb that dates back to the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). It is attributed to the Chinese philosopher and historian, Ban Gu (32-92 CE), who wrote in his book ""Hanshu"" (History of the Han Dynasty): ""When the local person is confused, the outside observer is clear."" The idiom suggests that people who are directly involved in a situation often become confused and lose their objectivity, while those who are outside the situation can see things more clearly and objectively. This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone who is too close to a problem cannot see a solution, but someone who is outside the situation can offer a clear and objective perspective. The idiom is also used to caution against the dangers of groupthink and the importance of seeking outside perspectives and expertise. In modern times, the idiom is often used in business, politics, and other fields to encourage people to seek outside advice and to avoid being too close to a problem.

The idiom ""百年好合"" is often used to describe a romantic relationship, but it can also be used to describe other types of partnerships or friendships.  The idiom is a combination of two characters: ""百年"" meaning ""a hundred years"" and ""好合"" meaning ""good match"" or ""well-suited"". The idiom suggests that the two individuals are so well-suited to each other that they can last for a hundred years together.  In the example sentence, the idiom is used to describe the couple's marriage, implying that they are a perfect match and their relationship is strong and happy.  This idiom is often used in Chinese literature and poetry to describe ideal relationships, and it has a romantic and nostalgic connotation.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used in a more general sense to describe any type of partnership or friendship that is strong and well-suited.  Overall, the idiom ""百年好合"" is a beautiful and evocative expression that captures the idea of a perfect match or a well-suited partnership.

Therefore, the word-by-word translation is ""One hundred years good harmony"".  The idiom ""百年好合"" is often used to describe a long-lasting and harmonious relationship between people. It can be used to express the idea that two people have been together for a long time and have maintained a good relationship.

百闻不如一见,Seeing is believing,Seeing is better than hearing,"A hundred times hearing is not like one time seeing. Answer: Seeing is believing.  Explanation: The idiom ""百闻不如一见"" is a Chinese proverb that means ""hearing about something a hundred times is not as good as seeing it once."" It suggests that direct observation and experience are more valuable than hearsay or second-hand information. The idiom is often used to convey the idea that one should not rely solely on what others say, but rather experience things for oneself to form a true understanding. In this context, the translation ""Seeing is believing"" is a more idiomatic translation that conveys the same meaning.  Note: The literal translation of the idiom is ""A hundred times hearing is not like one time seeing"", but this translation is not as natural or idiomatic as ""Seeing is believing"".

轻于鸿毛,Lighter than a (goose) feather - a death which is of no significance at all,Lighter than a feather,"This question is extremely difficult, even I can't solve it. Answer: This question is extremely difficult, even I can't solve it. Explanation: The idiom ""轻于鸿毛"" is a metaphorical expression that compares something to a feather, which is extremely light. Therefore, when someone says ""轻于鸿毛"", they mean that the task or challenge is so difficult that it's almost impossible to accomplish, just like a feather is so light that it's almost weightless. This idiom is often used to express frustration or helplessness when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.

It is used to describe a person who is a traitor or a double agent, often in a situation where they are working for two opposing sides.
