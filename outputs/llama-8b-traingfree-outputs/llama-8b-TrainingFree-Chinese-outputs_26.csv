无庸赘述,It's unnecessary to go into details,Needless to say,"It goes without saying.  Answer: No need to add extra words.  Explanation: The idiom ""无庸赘述"" is a literal translation of the phrase. ""无庸"" means ""no need"", ""赘"" means ""extra"" or ""superfluous"", and ""述"" means ""words"" or ""statements"". Therefore, the idiom can be translated to ""No need to add extra words"". This idiom is often used to indicate that something is self-evident or unnecessary to explain further.  In other words, it means that the point is already clear and there's no need to elaborate or add more details.  Example sentence: ""无庸赘述，大家都知道这件事了。"" (No need to add extra words, everyone already knows about this thing.)  In this sentence, the speaker is implying that the information is already well-known and doesn't need to be explained further.  The idiom is often used in formal or written communication, such as in essays, reports, or official documents, to convey a sense of clarity and concision.

(The company's new policy stirred wind, and soon the whole city was ignited.)  Note: This idiom is often used to describe a situation where a small incident or action sets off a much larger and more intense reaction.  In the example sentence, the company's new policy is the ""stirring wind"" that ignites the fire of controversy and uproar.  This idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that the situation is getting out of control.  However, it can also be used in a positive sense, implying that a small action or idea has the potential to spark a much larger and more positive movement.

The idiom is thought to have originated from the idea that a small spark can ignite a large fire, and that a small action can have a big impact.  It is often used in a variety of contexts, including politics, business, and social movements.

The idiom is used to describe someone who represents the interests of the people and seeks to carry out their wishes.  In this case, the translation is quite literal, but it's worth noting that the idiom has a more nuanced meaning in practice.  For example, a politician who claims to be ""为民请命"" might be seen as someone who genuinely represents the interests of the people, rather than just pursuing their own agenda.  However, the literal translation is still the most accurate representation of the idiom's components.  The idiom is often used in a political context, but it can also be used more broadly to describe someone who advocates for the rights and interests of a particular group.  For example, a lawyer who represents a client in a court of law might be said to be ""为民请命"" if they are fighting to protect their client's rights and interests.  Again, the idiom has a more nuanced meaning in practice, but the literal translation is still the most accurate representation of the idiom's components.  Overall, the idiom is a powerful expression of the importance of representing the interests of the people and seeking to carry out their wishes.  It is a reminder that those in positions of power have a responsibility to serve the people, rather than just pursuing their own interests.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including politics, law, and social activism.  It is a powerful tool for advocating for the rights and interests of a particular group, and it is a reminder of the importance of representation and accountability in government and other institutions.  In practice, the idiom is often used to describe someone who is seen as a champion of the people, rather than just a representative of the government or other powerful interests.  This can be seen in the way that the idiom is often used to describe politicians who are seen as being in touch with the concerns and needs of their constituents, rather than just pursuing their own agenda.  Again, the idiom has a more nuanced meaning in practice, but the literal translation is still the most accurate representation of the idiom's components.  Overall, the idiom is a powerful expression of the importance of representing the interests of the people and seeking to carry out their wishes"

Answer: to become a member of a group or organization without going through the formal process of joining, implying that the person has earned the respect and trust of the group. Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer: Enter the main hall, enter the inner room. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who is very confident and assertive, often to the point of being overly aggressive or presumptuous. It literally means to enter the main hall and then enter the inner room of a house, which is the most private and intimate space. In ancient China, the main hall was where guests were received, but the inner room was reserved for the family and was not open to visitors. Therefore, to enter both the main hall and the inner room would be a sign of great familiarity and confidence.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe someone who is pushy or overbearing, especially in a social or professional setting. For example, ""He's always trying to insert himself into our conversations, it's like he's trying to enter the main hall and then the inner room.""  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is trying to gain an advantage or get an upper hand, often by being overly aggressive or manipulative. It can also be used to describe someone who is trying to gain access to something that is not available to everyone, such as a secret or a privileged position.  In some cases, the idiom can also be used to describe someone who is trying to gain the trust or confidence of someone else, often by being overly friendly or flattering.  Overall, the idiom is used to describe someone who is trying to exert control or influence over others, often by being overly aggressive or manipulative.  The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that the person is being overbearing or presumptuous.  However, it can also be used in a positive sense, implying that the person is confident and assertive, but not in a way that is overly aggressive or manipulative.  For example, ""She's a very confident person, she's not afraid to enter the main hall and then the inner room.""

In this example, the company's financial situation is described as being severely damaged and chaotic, with many problems and issues that need to be addressed.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation that is absurd or ridiculous.  For example, ""The politician's promises were like a thousand holes and ten thousand sores - they sounded good but were completely empty.""  In this example, the politician's promises are described as being empty and lacking substance, much like a thousand holes and ten thousand sores.  The idiom is also used to describe a situation that is hopeless or desperate.  For instance, ""The patient's condition was a thousand holes and ten thousand sores, and the doctors were unable to save them.""  In this example, the patient's condition is described as being severe and hopeless, with many problems and issues that need to be addressed.  The idiom is often used in a more formal or literary context to describe a situation that is complex or multifaceted.  For example, ""The city's social problems were a thousand holes and ten thousand sores, and required a comprehensive solution.""  In this example, the city's social problems are described as being complex and multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive solution to address the many issues and problems.

福无双至,Blessings never come in pairs,Fu Wushuang arrives,"Good fortune never comes twice.  Explanation: The idiom ""福无双至"" is a Chinese proverb that means ""good fortune never comes twice."" It suggests that once a person experiences good fortune, it is unlikely to happen again. This idiom is often used to caution people against taking their good fortune for granted and to remind them to appreciate and make the most of the opportunities they have. The literal translation ""good fortune without double arrival"" conveys the idea that good fortune is a singular event that may not recur. In English, it can be translated as ""good fortune never comes twice,"" which is a more natural and idiomatic expression. This translation conveys the idea that good fortune is fleeting and should be appreciated and made the most of when it occurs.  The idiom ""福无双至"" is a reminder that good fortune is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, and that it is essential to appreciate and make the most of it when it occurs. It is a cautionary tale that encourages people to be grateful for the good fortune they have and to make the most of the opportunities that come their way.  The idiom ""福无双至"" is a reminder that good fortune is a rare and precious thing, and that it is essential to appreciate and make the most of it when it occurs. It is a reminder that good fortune is not a permanent state and that it is essential to be grateful and make the most of the opportunities that come our way.

秀而不实,Flowering but producing no fruit,Show but not truth,Show but not substantial Answer:
私相授受,Make an illicit transfer,Give and receive privately,"Private mutual giving and receiving.  I'd like to know how you got this translation.  Here's my thought process:  The character 私 means ""private"" or ""personal"", the character 相 means ""mutual"" or ""reciprocal"", and the character 受 means ""to receive"".  So, the idiom should be translated as ""private mutual receiving"".  However, the character 相 can also mean ""to give"" or ""to bestow"", and the character 受 can also mean ""to give"" or ""to bestow"".  Therefore, the idiom should also be translated as ""private mutual giving"".  Combining the two possible translations, I get ""private mutual giving and receiving"".  Is this correct?  Or did I miss something?  I'd appreciate any feedback.  Thank you."

It is often used to describe someone who stays out of trouble or controversy. Literal translation is ""place oneself outside of things"", which is a direct translation of the characters. The word ""place"" (置) is a verb that means to put or place something in a certain position, and ""oneself"" (身) refers to the speaker or oneself. ""Things"" (事) refers to events, situations, or matters. So, the idiom literally means to put oneself outside of events or situations. This translation is faithful to the original characters and conveys the same meaning as the idiom.  Note: The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that someone is avoiding responsibility or involvement in a situation. However, the literal translation does not convey this nuance, and the idiom should be used in context to understand its intended meaning.  Example sentence: ""他置身事外，不参与公司的内部纠纷。"" (He places himself outside of things and doesn't participate in the company's internal conflicts.)  In this sentence, the idiom is used to describe someone who stays out of trouble and avoids involvement in company conflicts.  Another example sentence: ""她置身事外，避免了许多麻烦。"" (She places herself outside of things and avoids many troubles.)  In this sentence, the idiom is used to describe someone who remains detached and avoids trouble.  Both examples illustrate the idiom's meaning and usage.  Note: The idiom can also be translated as ""keep oneself out of things"" or ""stay out of things"", but these translations are not as literal as the original characters.  Answer:  Keep out of it.  Explanation: This idiom means to remain neutral and uninvolved in a situation, often to avoid taking responsibility or blame. Literal translation is ""place oneself outside of things"", which is a direct translation of the characters. The word ""place"" (置) is a verb that means to put or place something in a certain position, and ""oneself"" (身) refers to the speaker or oneself. ""Things"" (事) refers to events, situations, or matters. So, the idiom literally means to put oneself outside of events or situations. This translation is faithful to the original characters and conveys the same meaning as the idiom.  Note: The id"
美中不足,A blemish in an otherwise perfect thing,A fly in the ointment,"Lacking in beauty, yet insufficient. Answer: Lacking in beauty, yet insufficient.

见风转舵,See how the wind blows,See the wind,"This idiom means to change one's opinion or course of action in response to external influences or circumstances. The phrase is derived from sailing, where the rudder is turned in response to the wind direction. In the context of human behavior, it suggests that one is easily swayed by external factors, rather than maintaining a consistent or independent course.  Example sentence: ""After hearing the news, he saw the wind turn the rudder and changed his mind about the project.""  In this sentence, the speaker is implying that the person's decision was influenced by external factors, rather than a genuine change of heart.  The idiom is often used to convey a sense of opportunism or lack of principle.  Note: The idiom is often used in a negative light, implying that the person is being insincere or lacking in conviction.  However, it can also be used in a more neutral or even positive sense, depending on the context.  For example, a business leader might say ""We saw the wind turn the rudder and adjusted our strategy to meet the changing market conditions.""  In this case, the idiom is used to convey a sense of adaptability and responsiveness to external factors.  Overall, the idiom is a useful way to describe the complex and often nuanced relationships between individuals, circumstances, and decision-making processes.  I hope this helps!

铤而走险,Rush headlong into danger,Take the risk,-
锋芒所向,Target of attack,The direction of the edge,"The sharp edge points towards.  Explanation: This idiom means ""to be directed at"" or ""to be aimed at"". It is used to describe a situation where one person or thing is the target of another person's or thing's efforts or attacks. The idiom is composed of two characters: 锋 (fēng) meaning ""sharp"" or ""keen"", and 芒 (máng) meaning ""edge"" or ""point"". Together, they form the phrase 锋芒 (fēngmáng) meaning ""sharp edge"" or ""pointed tip"". The character 所 (suǒ) is a possessive particle, and 向 (xiàng) means ""towards"" or ""directed at"". Therefore, the idiom 锋芒所向 literally means ""the sharp edge points towards"", implying that the sharp edge is directed at a specific target.  Example: ""The company's competitors are all aiming at our market share, so we need to be prepared to defend ourselves."" (公司的竞争对手都瞄准了我们的市场份额，所以我们需要准备好自卫。) In this example, the idiom 锋芒所向 is used to describe the situation where the company's competitors are targeting their market share. The idiom implies that the company is under attack and needs to be prepared to defend itself.  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense to describe a situation where someone or something is being targeted or attacked. However, it can also be used in a positive sense to describe a situation where someone or something is being aimed at or targeted for a specific purpose.  See also: 锋芒在眉睫  (fēngmáng zài méi jì) - a similar idiom that means ""the sharp edge is at the eyebrow"" or ""the danger is near"".  Related idioms: 锋芒在眉睫 (fēngmáng zài méi jì) - the sharp edge is at the eyebrow 锋芒在眉睫 (fēngmáng zài méi jì) - the danger is near  Last updated: 2023-02-20 16:47:44  Please let me know if you want me to add anything else.
