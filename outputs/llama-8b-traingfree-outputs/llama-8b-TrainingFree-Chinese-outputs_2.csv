众口铄金,Public opinion will fuse metals,All mouths of gold,"The movie's quality isn't high, but it's widely praised, and its box office is very good. Answer: The movie's quality isn't high, but it's widely praised, and its box office is very good. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where something is widely accepted or praised, even if it's not necessarily good or valuable in itself. In this case, the movie is widely praised, despite its low quality, and its box office is very good. This idiom is often used to caution against blindly following the opinions of the majority, and to encourage critical thinking and evaluation. It's also used to highlight the power of social influence and the importance of considering multiple perspectives when making judgments or decisions. The idiom is derived from the fact that the tongues of the multitude can melt gold, implying that the collective opinions of many people can shape or alter the value of something. In this example, the movie is like gold that is being melted by the positive opinions of many people, resulting in a very good box office. Note: This idiom is often used in academic, business, and social contexts to encourage critical thinking and evaluation, and to promote a more nuanced understanding of the world around us. It's a reminder that just because something is widely accepted or praised, it doesn't necessarily mean it's good or valuable, and that we should always strive to make informed decisions based on objective criteria. Usage: This idiom can be used in a variety of contexts, such as business, politics, or education, to describe situations where collective opinions or social norms can shape or alter the value or perception of something. For example, ""The new policy was widely praised by many experts, but its implementation was problematic."" or ""The company's new product was widely accepted by many customers, but its quality was not as good as expected."" Variations: There are several variations of this idiom, including ""众口铄金,众口难开"" (Many mouths melt gold, many mouths are hard to open), which emphasizes the idea that it's difficult to please everyone. Another variation is ""众口铄金,众口一辞"" (Many mouths melt gold, many mouths speak the same language), which suggests that many people can come together to express a unified opinion. Related Idioms: There are several related idioms that convey similar meanings, such as ""众口一辞"" (Many mouths speak the same language), ""众人拾柴火焰高"" (Many"

头痛医头，脚痛医脚,Treat symptoms but not the disease,"Headache doctor head, foot pain doctor foot","Treat the symptoms. Answer: Treat the symptoms. Explanation: This idiom means to treat the symptoms directly, rather than addressing the underlying cause. It is often used to describe a superficial or short-sighted approach to a problem.

风餐露宿,Brave wind and dew,Wind meal camping,"To live a life of poverty and hardship, with no fixed abode or regular income.  Explanation:  The idiom ""风餐露宿"" is a Chinese phrase that is often used to describe someone who is living a life of poverty and hardship.  The phrase is composed of three characters: ""风"" (fēng) meaning ""wind"", ""餐"" (chǎn) meaning ""eat"", and ""露"" (lù) meaning ""out in the open"", and ""宿"" (sù) meaning ""sleep"".  Together, these characters convey the idea of someone who is living a life of hardship and struggle, often with little food or shelter.  In this context, the translation ""to live a life of poverty and hardship, with no fixed abode or regular income"" is a more idiomatic and natural English translation of the phrase.  It conveys the same meaning and connotation as the original Chinese idiom, but in a more natural and fluent way.  Note: The translation is meant to be a more idiomatic and natural English translation, rather than a direct and literal translation.  The goal is to provide a translation that accurately conveys the meaning and connotation of the original Chinese idiom, while also being clear and easy to understand for English speakers.
