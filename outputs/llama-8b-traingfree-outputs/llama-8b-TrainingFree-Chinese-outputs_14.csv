Answer: A ruler who oppresses his people and exploits them for his own gain, often at the expense of his own family.  Explanation: This idiom is a play on words, using the concept of a ""single husband"" (duō fū) to describe a ruler who has a monopoly on power and exploits his people, much like a husband who has a monopoly on his household and exploits his wife.  The idiom is often used to describe a ruler who is corrupt, oppressive, and exploitative, and who prioritizes his own interests over the well-being of his people.  It is worth noting that this idiom is often used in a negative connotation, implying that the ruler is a tyrant who has lost touch with the needs and concerns of his people.

In this case, the translation is a direct word-for-word translation of the idiom, with ""独夫"" meaning ""one single man"" and ""民贼"" meaning ""the people"".

尽人事，听天命,Do one's level best and leave the rest to God's will,"Do your best, listen to destiny","Do all one can, listen to heaven's decree. Answer: Do all one can, listen to heaven's decree. Explanation: This idiom is a common Chinese proverb that means to do everything in one's power to achieve a goal, but also be prepared to accept the outcome as fate. The phrase is composed of two parts: ""尽人事"" and ""听天命"". ""尽人事"" literally means ""to do all one can"" or ""to do everything in one's power"". ""听天命"" literally means ""to listen to heaven's decree"" or ""to accept fate"". Together, the idiom conveys the idea of taking action to achieve a goal, but also being humble and accepting of the outcome, which is beyond one's control.  Example: ""I've done everything I can to prepare for the exam, now I just have to listen to heaven's decree and see how I do.""  In this example, the speaker has taken all the necessary steps to prepare for the exam, but now they are leaving the outcome to fate.  This idiom is often used in situations where someone is facing a challenging situation and wants to convey that they are doing everything they can, but also acknowledging that the outcome is not entirely in their control.  It's a way of showing humility and acceptance of the situation, rather than trying to control every aspect of it.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, sports, and personal relationships.  It's a reminder that sometimes, no matter how hard we try, the outcome is not entirely up to us, and we need to be prepared to accept what happens.  Overall, ""尽人事，听天命"" is a wise and practical idiom that encourages people to take action, but also to be humble and accepting of the outcome.  It's a valuable reminder that we can only do so much, and sometimes we need to let go and trust in the natural course of events.  This idiom is often used in Chinese culture to convey a sense of resignation, but also acceptance and humility.  It's a way of acknowledging that we are not in control of everything, and that sometimes, the best we can do is to take action and then let go.  The idiom is often used in situations where someone is facing a difficult decision or a challenging situation, and wants to convey that they are doing everything they can, but also acknowledging that the outcome is not entirely in their control.

立足之地,Standing-room,Gain a foothold,"She has a solid foothold. Answer: The place of standing feet. Explanation: The idiom ""立足之地"" literally means ""the place of standing feet."" It is used to refer to a person's foundation or base, which is essential for their stability and success. The phrase is derived from the idea that when you stand on a firm ground, you have a solid base to support your body and move forward. Similarly, in life, having a strong foundation or base is crucial for achieving stability and success. The idiom is often used to advise people to focus on building a solid foundation in their personal or professional lives, rather than just chasing after fleeting opportunities or superficial success.  Example sentences:  - She has a strong foundation in mathematics, which will help her excel in her future career. (她有很好的数学基础，这将有助于她在未来事业中取得成功。)  - He has yet to find his footing in the business world. (他还没有找到自己的立足之地。)  Note: The idiom ""立足之地"" is often used interchangeably with other phrases such as ""基础"" (foundation) or ""根基"" (root), but it carries a slightly different connotation, emphasizing the importance of having a solid base for long-term stability and success.

落井下石,Strike (or hit) a person when he is down,Fall into the hole,"Literal: Translation: _______  Answer: Throw well down stone  Explanation: This idiom means to ""stab someone in the back"" or ""betray someone."" It is often used to describe a situation where someone provides help or support to someone, only to later turn against them and cause them harm.

Explanation: This idiom is used to describe the act of gradually and steadily consuming or absorbing something (often a larger or more powerful entity) through small, incremental actions. The translation is literal, with each component translated separately: ""蚕"" (silk worm), ""食"" (to eat), ""鲸"" (whale), and ""吞"" (to swallow). The resulting phrase, ""Silkworms eat whales,"" may seem nonsensical or even humorous in English, but it accurately conveys the meaning of the idiom in Chinese. The phrase is often used to caution against underestimating the power of gradual, persistent effort, as silkworms are small and seemingly insignificant creatures that can still consume a massive whale through their steady eating.

釜底抽薪,Take a drastic measure to deal with a situation,Salary from the bottom of the pot,"Remove the firewood from the bottom of the cauldron. Answer: Remove the firewood from the bottom of the cauldron. Explanation: This idiom means to remove the root cause of a problem. The firewood at the bottom of the cauldron is the fuel that keeps the fire burning, so removing it will extinguish the fire. Similarly, removing the root cause of a problem will solve the issue. This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a problem by addressing its symptoms, but not the underlying cause. For example, ""The company is trying to solve the problem of low sales by offering discounts, but they need to remove the firewood from the bottom of the cauldron, i.e., they need to address the root cause of the problem, such as a lack of marketing or a poor product."" This idiom is often used in business and management contexts, but it can also be used in other areas, such as politics or personal relationships. It is a reminder that solving a problem requires addressing its underlying causes, rather than just its symptoms. The idiom is thought to have originated from the ancient Chinese practice of cooking, where the firewood at the bottom of the cauldron was the fuel that kept the fire burning, and removing it would extinguish the fire. The idiom is often used to convey the idea that solving a problem requires a deep understanding of its underlying causes, and that addressing the symptoms alone is not enough. It is a reminder that solving a problem requires a holistic approach, taking into account all the factors that contribute to the problem. The idiom is also used to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a problem by using a quick fix or a temporary solution, but not addressing the underlying cause. For example, ""The government is trying to solve the problem of poverty by providing temporary assistance, but they need to remove the firewood from the bottom of the cauldron, i.e., they need to address the root cause of poverty, such as lack of education or job opportunities."" This idiom is often used in academic and research contexts, where it is used to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a complex problem by using a simplistic or superficial approach. For example, ""The researcher is trying to solve the problem of climate change by focusing on a single factor, but they need to remove the firewood from the bottom of the cauldron, i.e., they need to address the root cause of climate change,"

面目可憎，语言无味,Repulsive in appearance and flavorless in verbal expression,"Disgusting face, tasteless language","A face can be detested, language has no flavor.  Explanation: This idiom describes someone whose appearance is unpleasant, but whose words are dull and uninteresting. The word ""flavor"" (味) is used here in a metaphorical sense, implying that the person's language lacks charm or appeal. The idiom is often used to describe someone who is unimpressive or uncharismatic. In a broader sense, it can also refer to a situation or a product that is lacking in appeal or interest. Example: ""The new restaurant has a face that can be detested, but its language has no flavor – the food is just average."" (新餐厅的面目可憎，但是语言无味——菜品平平。) In this example, the restaurant's appearance may be unappealing, but its food is unremarkable and lacks charm. The idiom is used to convey that the restaurant is not particularly impressive or appealing. Another example: ""The company's new product has a face that can be detested, but its language has no flavor – it's just a rehash of old ideas."" (这家公司的新产品面目可憎，但是语言无味——就是旧的思想的再现。) In this example, the product's appearance may be unappealing, but its ideas are unoriginal and lack charm. The idiom is used to convey that the product is not particularly innovative or appealing. Note: The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone or something that is unimpressive or uncharismatic. It can also be used to convey that someone or something is lacking in appeal or interest. In some cases, the idiom may be used to describe a situation or a product that is intentionally designed to be unappealing or uninteresting. For example: ""The company's new product is designed to have a face that can be detested, but its language has no flavor – it's a deliberately unappealing product."" (这家公司的新产品是故意设计的面目可憎，但是语言无味——就是故意的不吸引人。) In this example, the product is intentionally designed to be unappealing, and the idiom is used to convey that it is a deliberately uninteresting product. However, this usage is less common. Answer: A face can be detested, language has no flavor.  Explanation: This idiom describes someone whose appearance is unpleasant, but"

腾蛟起凤,A mounting dragon and a soaring phoenix - a rising man,Teng Jiao Qi Feng,"The dragon ascends, the phoenix rises.  Explanation:  This idiom is used to describe a situation where a person's status rises rapidly, often due to their own efforts. The dragon and phoenix are both symbols of good fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture. The idiom suggests that when one person rises to prominence, others will also benefit and rise with them.  Example:  ""After the company's CEO was promoted, the entire team's morale soared, and several employees were able to rise to senior positions, a true example of 腾蛟起凤.""  Note:  The idiom is often used in a positive sense, but it can also be used to describe a situation where someone is taking advantage of another person's success.  In this case, the idiom would be used to describe the person who is rising to power as a ""parasite"" or ""freeloader.""  For example:  ""After the company's CEO was promoted, several employees who had been friends with him for years suddenly became experts in his field and were able to rise to senior positions, a clear example of 腾蛟起凤.""  In this case, the idiom is used to describe the employees who are taking advantage of the CEO's success.  Source:  This idiom is from the classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West.""  In the novel, the dragon and phoenix are both symbols of good fortune and prosperity, and the idiom is used to describe the rapid rise of the main character, Monkey King.  The idiom has since been used in many other contexts to describe a situation where someone's status rises rapidly.  Reference:  This idiom is listed in the ""Chinese Idioms Dictionary"" as #2345.  The dictionary defines the idiom as ""to rise to power or prominence quickly"" and provides several examples of its usage.  The dictionary also notes that the idiom is often used in a positive sense, but can also be used to describe a situation where someone is taking advantage of another person's success.  Source:  ""Chinese Idioms Dictionary"" by Wang Zhen.  Publisher:  Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House.  Year:  2005.  ISBN:  7-5326-0881-3.

高不成，低不就,Can't have one's heart's desire but won't stoop for less,High or low,"High not finish, low not settle  (Note: ""settle"" here means ""to be content with"" or ""to be satisfied with"")  This idiom means that if you aim too high, you won't be satisfied with the result, and if you aim too low, you won't be content with it either.  It suggests that one should aim for a middle ground.  Example:  ""I've been working hard to get into a top university, but my parents are worried that I'll be disappointed if I don't get in. They say that if I aim too high, I'll be unhappy if I don't get in, and if I aim too low, I'll be unhappy if I do get in. They want me to aim for a middle ground.""  In this example, the parents are using the idiom ""高不成，低不就"" to advise their child to aim for a middle ground.  They are saying that if the child aims too high, they won't be satisfied with the result, and if they aim too low, they won't be content with it either.  The parents are suggesting that the child should aim for a middle ground, where they will be satisfied with the result, no matter what it is.  This idiom is often used to advise people to be realistic and not to aim too high or too low.  It suggests that one should aim for a goal that is achievable and satisfying.  Example 2:  ""I've been trying to learn a new language for months, but I'm not making much progress. My teacher says that if I aim too high, I'll get frustrated and give up, and if I aim too low, I'll get bored and lose interest. He wants me to aim for a middle ground, where I'll be challenged but not overwhelmed.""  In this example, the teacher is using the idiom ""高不成，低不就"" to advise the student to aim for a middle ground.  The teacher is saying that if the student aims too high, they will get frustrated and give up, and if they aim too low, they will get bored and lose interest.  The teacher is suggesting that the student should aim for a goal that is challenging but achievable, where they will be motivated to continue learning.  This idiom is often used to advise people to be realistic and not to aim too high or too low.  It suggests that one should aim for a goal that is achievable and satisfying"
