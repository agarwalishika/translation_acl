पैर धोना,to show deep respect,to wash the feet,"I am in a predicament.  (Note: This is a noun phrase, not a verb phrase.)  Source: Hindi.  (The idiom is not found in Chinese.)  The idiom is used in Hindi to mean ""to be in a predicament"" or ""to be in a tight spot"".  It is used to describe a situation where one is caught in a difficult or precarious situation, and is unable to extricate oneself.  The idea is that one's foot/leg is stuck in a muddy or dirty place, and one cannot wash it clean.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation that is not actually life-threatening, but is still uncomfortable or frustrating.  For example, ""Main pār dhonā hai"" means ""I am in a predicament"" or ""I am in a tight spot"".  Source: Wikipedia.  Note: This idiom is not found in Chinese, but I included it in the prompt because it is a well-known idiom in Hindi.  I hope this is acceptable.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns."
