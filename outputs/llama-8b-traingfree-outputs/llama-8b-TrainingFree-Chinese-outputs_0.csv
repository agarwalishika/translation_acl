This idiom is often used to encourage teamwork and collaboration. Example: ""We need to work together to finish this project on time. It's like the wall falls, the people push."" (我们需要齐心协力才能在规定时间内完成这个项目。像墙倒了，众人推一样。) In this example, the speaker is urging the team to work together to meet the deadline, using the idiom to convey the idea that collective effort is necessary to achieve success. Note: This idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""wall"" represents a challenge or obstacle, and the ""people"" represent the individuals working together to overcome it. In this sense, the idiom is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a metaphor for teamwork and collaboration.

茁壮成长,Grow up healthy and strong,Growing up healthily,"Vigorous and robust growth Answer: Vigorous and robust growth Explanation: This idiom describes the process of growth and development, emphasizing the idea of rapid and healthy expansion. It is often used to describe the growth of plants, but can also be applied to other areas, such as business or personal development. The idiom is composed of two characters: 茁 (zhū) and 壮 (zhuàng). 茁 (zhū) means to be vigorous or robust, while 壮 (zhuàng) means to grow or flourish. Together, they convey the idea of rapid and healthy growth. In everyday language, the idiom is often used to describe someone or something that is thriving and flourishing. For example: ""The company has been experiencing 茁壮成长 over the past year, with significant increases in revenue and employee numbers."" (The company has been experiencing vigorous and robust growth over the past year, with significant increases in revenue and employee numbers.)  In this example, the idiom is used to describe the company's rapid growth and development. It suggests that the company is thriving and flourishing, with a strong and healthy trajectory. Overall, the idiom 茁壮成长 is a powerful and evocative expression that conveys the idea of rapid and healthy growth. It is a useful tool for describing the growth and development of individuals, businesses, and other entities.  Note: The idiom is often used in a positive context, but it can also be used in a negative context to describe something that is growing too quickly or out of control. For example: ""The company's rapid 茁壮成长 has led to a series of financial problems and regulatory issues."" (The company's rapid vigorous and robust growth has led to a series of financial problems and regulatory issues.)  In this example, the idiom is used to describe the company's rapid growth as a problem, rather than a positive development. This highlights the importance of using the idiom in context and considering the nuances of its meaning.

萧规曹随,Follow established rules,Xiao Gui Cao Sui,"Xie rules Cao follow. Answer: Xie rules Cao follow.  Explanation: The idiom ""萧规曹随"" is a phrase that means ""to follow the rules of Cao"" or ""to follow the regulations of Cao."" It is often used to describe someone who is obedient and follows the rules without question. The phrase is derived from the name of the Cao family, who were known for their strict adherence to rules and regulations. In this context, ""Xie"" is not a separate word, but rather part of the family name ""Cao Xie."" Therefore, the literal translation of the idiom is ""Cao Xie rules follow."" However, since ""Cao Xie"" is not a common name, it is often simplified to ""Cao rules follow"" or ""Xie rules Cao follow."" The correct translation is indeed ""Xie rules Cao follow.""  Note: The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is overly obedient or rigid in their adherence to rules. For example, ""He's so strict, he follows the rules of Cao!"" (他这么严格，跟曹规随的似的!)  In this sense, the idiom is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a playful way to describe someone's behavior.  The idiom is not commonly used in modern Chinese, and is mostly found in classical literature or in humorous contexts.  It is worth noting that the idiom is not related to the famous Chinese general Cao Cao, who was known for his cunning and military prowess. The idiom ""萧规曹随"" is actually a reference to the Cao family's reputation for strict adherence to rules, rather than any specific historical figure.  In summary, the idiom ""萧规曹随"" means ""to follow the rules of Cao"" or ""to follow the regulations of Cao,"" and is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe someone who is overly obedient or rigid in their adherence to rules. The correct translation is indeed ""Xie rules Cao follow.""  I hope this clears up any confusion. Let me know if you have any further questions!  I'd be happy to help."

For example, ""This suitcase is 轻于鸿毛, it's so easy to carry."" (This suitcase is lighter than a feather of a wild goose, it's so easy to carry.) Note: The idiom 轻于鸿毛 is often used in a humorous or exaggerated way to emphasize the lightness or ease of something. It's not meant to be taken literally, but rather to add emphasis and create a vivid image in the listener's mind. Example sentences: - 这个包包轻于鸿毛，很容易背。 (This bag is lighter than a feather of a wild goose, it's very easy to carry.) - 这个书包轻于鸿毛，根本不累。 (This backpack is lighter than a feather of a wild goose, it's not heavy at all.) - 这个衣服轻于鸿毛，穿起来很舒服。 (This shirt is lighter than a feather of a wild goose, it's very comfortable to wear.) In these examples, the idiom 轻于鸿毛 is used to add emphasis and create a vivid image in the listener's mind. It's not meant to be taken literally, but rather to convey the idea that something is extremely light or easy to handle. Other translations: - As light as a feather - Extremely light - Very easy to handle - Extremely easy to carry Note: The idiom 轻于鸿毛 can be translated in different ways depending on the context and the desired emphasis. However, the literal translation ""Lighter than a feather of a wild goose"" is the most direct and faithful translation of the idiom. Other idioms: - 轻如鸿毛 (Light as a feather of a wild goose) - 轻如鸥毛 (Light as a feather of a bird)"

远水不救近火,Water far away is not of much use in putting out a fire,Far water does not save near fire,"Distant water does not save near fire. Answer: Distant water does not save near fire. Explanation: This idiom means that a distant or external solution cannot solve a problem that is close at hand. It is often used to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a problem that is too close to them by looking for a solution from someone or something far away. The idiom is derived from a common saying that ""distant water cannot put out a nearby fire."" The idea is that water is most effective when it is applied directly to the fire, rather than trying to use water from a distant source. In the same way, a solution to a problem is most effective when it is applied directly to the problem, rather than trying to use a solution from a distant source. Example: ""I don't think that new policy will solve our company's problems. It's like trying to put out a fire with distant water."" In this example, the speaker is saying that the new policy is not a practical solution to the company's problems because it is too distant and does not address the root of the issue. Another example: ""I don't think that new gadget will help me with my math homework. It's like trying to put out a fire with distant water."" In this example, the speaker is saying that the new gadget is not a practical solution to their math homework problems because it is too distant and does not address the root of the issue. The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a problem by looking for a solution from someone or something far away. For example: ""I'm trying to solve my relationship problems by reading self-help books written by people who have never been in a relationship. It's like trying to put out a fire with distant water!"" In this example, the speaker is being humorous and ironic by saying that they are trying to solve their relationship problems by reading books written by people who have never been in a relationship. This is an obvious example of trying to solve a problem with a distant solution. The idiom is also used in a more serious way to describe a situation where someone is trying to solve a problem by looking for a solution from someone or something far away. For example: ""I'm trying to solve my company's financial problems by hiring a consultant who has no experience in our industry. It's like trying to put out a fire with distant water."" In this example, the speaker is"

酒肉朋友,Fair-weather friends,Wine and meat friends,"He's more of a drinking buddy than a real friend, and we don't really talk about other things.

鸡鸣狗盗,Small tricks,Crowing and dog thieves,"The rooster crows, the dog steals.  The Chinese idiom is literally translated as the English sentence.  The idiom is an example of a ""meaningful phrase"" or ""idiomatic expression"" in Chinese.  The phrase is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a metaphorical expression.  In this case, the idiom ""鸡鸣狗盗"" means ""to act in a way that is not consistent with one's nature or character.""  The rooster is known for crowing at dawn, while the dog is known for barking at night.  Therefore, if a rooster were to bark and a dog were to crow, it would be unnatural and inconsistent with their typical behavior.  Similarly, if someone were to act in a way that is not consistent with their nature or character, it would be like a rooster barking or a dog crowing.  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is pretending to be something they are not, or who is acting in a way that is not authentic to who they are.  For example, someone who is normally shy and introverted might be described as ""鸡鸣狗盗"" if they were to suddenly become outgoing and extroverted.  The idiom is often used to convey a sense of irony or incongruity, and to suggest that someone is not being true to themselves.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is trying to pass themselves off as something they are not, or where someone is pretending to have a certain quality or characteristic that they do not actually possess.  For example, someone who is trying to appear wealthy and successful might be described as ""鸡鸣狗盗"" if they are actually struggling financially.  The idiom is a powerful tool for conveying complex ideas and emotions in a concise and evocative way, and is often used in literature and everyday conversation to add depth and nuance to language.  In conclusion, the Chinese idiom ""鸡鸣狗盗"" is a rich and multifaceted expression that conveys a sense of irony, incongruity, and inauthenticity.  Its literal meaning is ""the rooster crows, the dog steals,"" but its figurative meaning is much deeper and more complex.  The idiom is a valuable tool for anyone looking to add depth and nuance to their language.  Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer: The ro"
