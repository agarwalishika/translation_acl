无源之水，无本之木,Watery without a source and a tree without roots,"Water without source, wood without root","This project had no foundation or basis, and therefore failed quickly. Answer: This project had no foundation or basis, and therefore failed quickly.  Explanation: This idiom means something that has no foundation or basis.  It is used to describe a situation or a person that is unstable or lacking in substance.  The idiom is often used to caution against taking something at face value or to warn against the dangers of superficiality.  For example: ""The company's success is no more than a flash in the pan, a no-source water that will eventually dry up.""

The idiom is often used in a negative sense to caution against the dangers of superficiality and to encourage people to look beyond the surface level.  However, it can also be used in a positive sense to encourage people to build a strong foundation and to work hard to achieve their goals.

In this example, the idiom is used to suggest that the company's success is based on a strong foundation and will therefore be lasting.

争长论短,Squabble,Debating long and short,"Engage in petty or pointless arguments. Answer: Argue about being the elder; discuss the inferior. Explanation: 争 (to contend, to dispute) + 长 (long, old, elder) + 论 (to discuss, to talk about) + 短 (short, inferior) This idiom is used to describe a situation where people argue over trivial matters, often in a petty or childish manner. It can also be used to describe someone who is overly concerned with their own status or position. Example: ""Stop arguing with your sibling about who's the elder; it's just a waste of time."" ""He's always trying to one-up his colleagues, but it's just a case of arguing about being the elder and discussing the inferior."" Note: This idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to poke fun at people who engage in petty arguments or status-seeking behavior. It's not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a lighthearted way to point out the absurdity of such behavior. In some cases, the idiom may be used to describe a situation where people are arguing over something that is not worth arguing about, or where the argument is not based on any real substance or merit. In these cases, the idiom is used to suggest that the argument is a waste of time and energy, and that the participants should focus on more important or meaningful issues.

盲人摸象,One-sided view,Blind man touching elephant,"Blind person touch elephant Answer: Blind person touch elephant  Translation notes: This idiom is a common Chinese expression that means ""to know something superficially"" or ""to have a limited understanding of a complex issue."" It is derived from the ancient Indian story of a blind man trying to understand an elephant by touching different parts of its body, resulting in a fragmented and inaccurate picture of the whole.

Example sentence: ""You can't understand the company's financial situation just by looking at the surface, it's like a blind person touching an elephant.""

In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is trying to understand a complex issue, but is only able to see a small part of it.

It encourages people to look deeper and seek a more complete understanding of a situation.  The idiom is also a reminder that complex issues often have multiple facets and perspectives, and that it's impossible to fully understand something without considering all of these factors.

知其一，不知其二,Have only a one-sided view,"I know one, don't know the other","If you know one part, you must also know the other parts."
知无不言，言无不尽,Speak unreservedly,"Know everything, speak everything","Know no unspoken, speak no unspoken-out.  Note: The English translation is a bit awkward, but it's a faithful representation of the Chinese idiom. The idiom is often translated as ""Speak freely and speak fully,"" but that loses some of the nuance of the original phrase.  The Chinese idiom is a play on words, using the same character (言) for ""speak"" and ""spoken"" to create a clever connection between the two concepts.  In the English translation, ""unspoken"" and ""spoken-out"" are used to maintain the connection between the two concepts, even if it's a bit awkward.  The goal is to provide a literal, word-by-word translation, rather than a more idiomatic or natural-sounding translation.  This approach helps to preserve the original meaning and structure of the Chinese idiom.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

Explanation: This idiom is composed of two Chinese characters: ""立"" (lì) meaning ""stand"" and ""身"" (shēn) meaning ""body"", ""处"" (chù) meaning ""place"" and ""世"" (shì) meaning ""world"". The translation is a direct, word-for-word rendering of the characters, without any attempt to interpret or paraphrase the meaning. The result is a somewhat awkward-sounding English phrase that conveys the literal meaning of the idiom."
立足之地,Standing-room,Gain a foothold,"Without a stable foundation, it's hard for a person to walk the road.  Explanation: This idiom is a reminder that one's success or failure in life often depends on the stability of their foundation. Just like how a tree needs a strong root system to stand tall, a person needs a solid foundation to achieve their goals. Without a stable foundation, one is more likely to stumble and fall, just like a person walking on shaky ground. This idiom encourages people to focus on building a strong foundation, whether it's through education, hard work, or a clear plan, to increase their chances of success.  Usage: This idiom can be used in various situations, such as when advising someone to focus on their studies, warning someone about the dangers of taking unnecessary risks, or encouraging someone to think carefully before making a decision. For example: ""You need to focus on your studies and build a strong foundation in your field before you can expect to succeed in your career."" (lit. ""you need to stand firmly on your ground"") ""Don't take unnecessary risks without thinking carefully about the consequences. You might end up falling into trouble."" (lit. ""don't walk on shaky ground"") ""Before making a decision, take a step back and think about the potential outcomes. You don't want to fall into a trap."" (lit. ""don't walk into a pit without looking"")  Variations: This idiom can be modified to fit different situations. For example: ""立足之地不稳，行路之人难免坠落"" can be changed to ""立足之地不稳，人生之路难免坎坷"" to emphasize the difficulties and challenges that come with a unstable foundation. ""立足之地不稳，行路之人难免坠落"" can be changed to ""立足之地不稳，人生之路难免失落"" to emphasize the sense of loss and disappointment that comes with a unstable foundation.  Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer: The place of the standing foot.  Explanation: The idiom ""立足之地"" is a phrase that refers to a person's foundation or base of operation. It is a metaphorical expression that suggests that a person's success or stability is dependent on their ability to establish a strong foundation or base. The phrase is composed of two characters: ""立足"" which means ""to stand on one's feet"" and ""之地"" which means ""the"

虾兵蟹将,Ineffective troops,Shrimp soldier and crab general,Literal: Translation:
蚂蚁啃骨头,Plod away at a big job bit by bit,Ant chews on bone,"Ants gnaw bonehead.  Explanation: The idiom 蚂蚁啃骨头 is a metaphorical expression that means to be extremely diligent and persistent in one's work or efforts, often to the point of being annoying or tedious. The literal translation is ""ants gnaw bonehead,"" which is a vivid and humorous image that conveys the idea of small, persistent creatures wearing down a larger, more formidable target. In this case, the ""bonehead"" refers to a stubborn or obstinate person who refuses to yield or give in. The idiom is often used to describe someone who is annoyingly persistent or diligent, but ultimately achieves their goal through sheer hard work and determination.  Note: The idiom is often used in a slightly derogatory or ironic tone, implying that the person's persistence is almost laughable or pitiful.  Example sentence: ""He's been trying to convince me to invest in his business for months, and it's starting to feel like a bunch of ants gnawing on my bonehead – I just want him to give up already!""  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to express their frustration and annoyance at the person's persistence, implying that it's almost comical or absurd.

身先士卒,Lead one's men in a charge,Lead the way,"Body-first soldiers-follow.  Explanation: This idiom means to put the needs of others before one's own. The ""body"" refers to the person, and ""soldiers"" refers to the people one is responsible for. The phrase ""follow"" is used to indicate that the person is leading by example. In this context, ""body-first"" means that the person is putting their own body (or needs) last, and the needs of the soldiers (or others) first. This idiom is often used to describe a leader who is willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of their team or organization.  Example: The CEO of the company is known for putting the needs of her employees first, and is often seen as a role model for her leadership style. She is said to ""keep the body of the soldiers first."" (身先士卒)  In this example, the CEO is putting the needs of her employees (the soldiers) before her own needs (her body). This is an example of the idiom ""body-first soldiers-follow.""  Note: This idiom is often used in a more general sense to describe someone who is willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of others, not just in a leadership context. For example, a parent who puts their child's needs before their own is also said to ""keep the body of the soldiers first."" (身先士卒)  In this case, the parent is putting the needs of their child (the soldier) before their own needs (their body).  This idiom is often used to describe someone who is selfless and willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of others.  It is a positive trait that is highly valued in many cultures.  The opposite of this idiom would be ""self-first soldiers-follow"" (自先士卒), which would describe someone who puts their own needs before the needs of others.  This is generally considered to be a negative trait.  Note: The word ""士卒"" (shìzú) literally means ""soldiers"" or ""troops"", but it can also be used more broadly to refer to people in general. In this context, it is often translated as ""people"" or ""followers"".  The word ""身"" (shēn) literally means ""body"", but it can also be used to refer to a person or oneself. In this context, it is often translated as ""person"" or ""self"".  The phrase ""先"

隔墙有耳,Beware of eavesdroppers,Wall has ears,"They were having a secret conversation in a coffee shop, discussing internal company affairs.
