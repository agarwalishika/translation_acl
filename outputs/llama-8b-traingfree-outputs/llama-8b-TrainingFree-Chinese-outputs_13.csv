百孔千疮,In a disastrous state,Riddled with gaping wounds,"A thousand holes, a thousand sores.  Explanation: This idiom refers to a situation where something is severely damaged or worn out, to the point where it is almost beyond repair. The phrase ""百孔千疮"" is a metaphorical expression that describes the extent of the damage, with ""百孔"" implying a thousand holes and ""千疮"" implying a thousand sores. The translation is a direct, word-by-word translation of the idiom, conveying the severity of the damage.  In everyday language, this idiom is used to describe something that is severely damaged or worn out, such as a worn-out pair of shoes or a broken-down machine.  For example: ""这辆车已经百孔千疮了，没法再开了"" which translates to ""This car has a thousand holes and a thousand sores, it's no longer usable.""  The idiom is often used to convey a sense of severity and hopelessness, implying that something is beyond repair or salvageable.  Example sentences:  - 这辆车已经百孔千疮了，没法再开了。  - 这个旧电脑已经百孔千疮了，不能再用了。  - 这个衣服已经百孔千疮了，不能再穿了。  - 这个房子已经百孔千疮了，需要重建了。  Note: The idiom ""百孔千疮"" is often used in a negative context to describe something that is severely damaged or worn out.  However, it can also be used in a more positive context to describe something that has been thoroughly tested or proven to be reliable, such as a well-worn pair of shoes that have been thoroughly tested and proven to be reliable.  In this sense, the idiom can be used to convey a sense of trust and reliability, implying that something has been thoroughly tested and proven to be effective.  For example: ""这双鞋已经百孔千疮了，证明它是质量很好的鞋子"" which translates to ""This pair of shoes has a thousand holes and a thousand sores, proving that it's a high-quality shoe.""  However, this usage of the idiom is less common and is often used in a more humorous or ironic context.  In general, the idiom ""百孔千疮"" is used to convey a sense of severity and hopelessness, implying that something is beyond repair or salvageable."

For example:  ""He's always talking about how much he loves his family, but his actions show that he's just trying to impress his in-laws.""
