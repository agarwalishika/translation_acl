无敌于天下,Unmatched anywhere in the world,Invincible in the world,"Invincible in the world.  Answer: Without enemy in the world.  Explanation: The idiom ""无敌于天下"" is a translation of the phrase ""無敵於天下"" in Chinese.

真金不怕火,An honest person does not fear the light,Real gold is not afraid of fire,"Genuine gold is not afraid of fire testing.  Explanation: This idiom means that something of value will not be damaged by challenges or difficulties.  The idiom is composed of two Chinese characters: 真金 (zhēn jīn) and 不怕火試 (bù pà huǒ shì).  The first part, 真金, means ""genuine gold.""  The second part, 不怕火試, means ""not afraid of fire testing.""  The phrase ""fire testing"" is a metaphor for challenges or difficulties.  In ancient times, gold was often tested by fire to determine its purity.  If the gold was genuine, it would not melt or be damaged by the heat.  Therefore, the idiom suggests that something of value will not be harmed by challenges or difficulties.  Example sentence: ""She passed the difficult exam with flying colors, just like genuine gold that is not afraid of fire testing.""  In this sentence, the speaker is saying that the person who passed the exam is like genuine gold, which is not damaged by challenges or difficulties.  The idiom is often used to describe someone who is confident and capable of handling difficult situations.  It can also be used to describe something that is of high quality and can withstand challenges.  For example: ""The new smartphone is like genuine gold that is not afraid of fire testing.  It can withstand any challenge and perform well under any circumstances.""  In this sentence, the speaker is saying that the new smartphone is of high quality and can handle any challenge that comes its way.  The idiom is a common expression in Chinese culture and is often used in everyday conversation.  It is a way of saying that something is valuable and can withstand challenges, just like genuine gold that is not afraid of fire testing.  The idiom is also used in business and education to describe someone who is confident and capable of handling difficult situations.  For example: ""The CEO is like genuine gold that is not afraid of fire testing.  He can handle any challenge that comes his way and lead the company to success.""  In this sentence, the speaker is saying that the CEO is confident and capable of handling difficult situations, just like genuine gold that is not afraid of fire testing.  The idiom is a powerful expression that conveys a sense of confidence and capability.

For example, ""He spoke as his heart's voice, but his words were reckless and impulsive.""  In this sentence, ""心声"" refers to his emotional response, and ""言为"" indicates that he spoke in a way that was driven by his emotions rather than careful consideration.  Overall, the idiom ""言为心声"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of authenticity and sincerity in communication.  It encourages people to speak from the heart, rather than hiding behind masks or pretenses.  By doing so, we can build deeper connections with others and communicate more effectively.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, from personal relationships to business and politics.  It is a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their communication skills and build stronger relationships with others.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""言为心声"" also has a deeper symbolic meaning.  It suggests that our words have the power to reveal our true nature, and that we should strive to speak in a way that reflects our authentic selves.  This idea is rooted in the ancient Chinese concept of ""ren,"" or humaneness, which emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with others and being true to oneself.  By speaking as our heart's voice, we can cultivate a sense of ren and live in a more authentic and compassionate way.  The idiom"

金玉其外，败絮其中,Shining on the outside but rotten on the inside,"The gold and jade are outside, andthe corruption is in it","A beautiful appearance, but rotten inside.  Explanation: The idiom ""金玉其外，败絮其中"" is a metaphorical expression that describes someone or something that appears beautiful or impressive on the outside, but is actually rotten or flawed on the inside. The phrase is derived from the description of a beautiful object, such as a piece of gold or jade, that is actually filled with worthless or useless material, like downy feathers. This idiom is often used to caution against judging something based on its appearance alone, and to encourage a more thorough examination of its inner qualities.  Example: The new restaurant looks fancy, but the food is terrible. It's like a gold jade with ruin downy feathers inside.  In this example, the restaurant's beautiful appearance is contrasted with its poor quality food, illustrating the idea that appearances can be deceiving.  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense, to describe something that is flawed or defective, but it can also be used positively to describe someone or something that appears ordinary on the outside, but has hidden qualities or talents.  Variations: There are several variations of this idiom, including ""金玉其外，败絮其中"" and ""金玉其表，败絮其中"". The difference between the two is that ""表"" means ""surface"" or ""outside"", while ""外"" means ""outside"" or ""beyond"". In general, the two phrases are used interchangeably, but ""表"" is slightly more formal or literary.  Related Idioms: This idiom is related to other phrases that describe the difference between appearance and reality, such as ""表面文章"" (surface-level words) and ""外表美丽，内心丑陋"" (beautiful appearance, ugly heart).  Synonyms: Some synonyms for this idiom include ""金山玉壶"" (golden mountain, jade jar) and ""金碧辉煌，内空虚"" (golden brilliance, empty inside).  Answer: A beautiful appearance, but rotten inside.

钱可通神,Money makes the mare go,Money can be transcendental,"Money can pass through the spirit. Answer: Money can buy everything.  Explanation: This idiom suggests that money can solve most problems and provide a sense of security, but it may not be able to buy spiritual or emotional fulfillment. It implies that while wealth can provide material comforts, it may not be able to bring true happiness or inner peace.  This idiom is often used to caution against the idea that wealth is the key to happiness. It encourages people to look beyond material wealth and consider the importance of relationships, personal growth, and spiritual fulfillment.  For example, a person who has a lot of money but is still unhappy or unfulfilled might be said to be ""buying everything"" with their wealth, implying that they are trying to fill a void or satisfy a deeper need with material possessions.  The idiom can also be used more broadly to describe situations where people are prioritizing material wealth above other aspects of their lives, such as relationships, health, or personal growth.  In this sense, the phrase is a reminder that true happiness and fulfillment come from living a balanced and meaningful life, rather than from accumulating wealth and material possessions.  By using this idiom, we can encourage ourselves and others to prioritize what truly matters and to avoid the trap of thinking that wealth is the key to happiness.

响遏行云,(of singing) reverberate through the skies,Sound stop cloud,"To be so afraid of something that you become paralyzed and unable to move or take action. Answer: You're frozen with fear.  Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where someone is so afraid of something that they become unable to move or take action. The phrase ""frozen with fear"" suggests that the person is paralyzed with fear, unable to move or function normally. This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is overwhelmed by fear or anxiety, and is unable to take action or make decisions.  Example: ""He was frozen with fear when he saw the snake, he couldn't move or speak.""

Another example: ""She was frozen with fear when she received the bad news, she couldn't make a decision or take action.""  In this example, the person was so afraid of the bad news that she became paralyzed with fear, unable to make a decision or take action.  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense, to describe a situation where someone is overwhelmed by fear or anxiety, and is unable to take action or make decisions.  However, it can also be used in a positive sense, to describe a situation where someone is taking a break or resting due to fear or anxiety.  For example: ""I was frozen with fear after the accident, I couldn't move or speak for hours.""  In this example, the person was so afraid of the accident that they became paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak for hours.  Note: This idiom is often used in a personal or emotional context, to describe a situation where someone is experiencing fear or anxiety.  However, it can also be used in other contexts, such as business or politics.  For example: ""The company was frozen with fear when it received the bad news, it couldn't make a decision or take action.""  In this example, the company was so afraid of the bad news that it became paralyzed with fear, unable to make a decision or take action.
