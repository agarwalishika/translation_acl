百废俱兴,Full-scale reconstruction is under way,Everything is booming,"All hundred things are flourishing together. Answer: After a period of chaos, everything is restored to its former state. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state after a period of chaos or decline. It is often used to describe a complete revival or recovery. The word ""百"" (bǎi) means ""hundred"", and ""废"" (fèi) means ""waste"" or ""ruin"", and ""俱"" (jù) means ""all"" or ""together"", and ""兴"" (xīng) means ""to flourish"" or ""to prosper"". Therefore, the literal translation is ""All hundred things are flourishing together"".  Note: This idiom is often used in a positive context, but it can also be used to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, but it's not necessarily a good thing. For example, a person might say ""百废俱兴"" to describe a situation where they are working too hard and everything is restored to its former state, but they are exhausted and not enjoying themselves.  In this case, the idiom is being used to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, but it's not necessarily a good thing.  Example sentence: ""经过一年的努力，公司的业务百废俱兴。"" (After a year of hard work, the company's business has been restored to its former state.)  This sentence uses the idiom to describe a situation where the company's business has been restored to its former state after a year of hard work.  Note: This idiom is often used in a more formal or literary context, and it's not commonly used in everyday conversation.  However, it's a useful idiom to know if you want to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, and you want to use a more formal or poetic tone.  Example: ""百废俱兴，恢复元气。"" (Everything is restored to its former state, and vitality is restored.)  This sentence uses the idiom to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, and vitality is restored.  Note: This idiom is often used to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, but it can also be used to describe a situation where everything is restored to its former state, but it's not necessarily a good thing.  For example, a person might"

稳操胜券,Have full assurance of success,Be sure to win,"She had a strong advantage throughout the competition and eventually won the championship. Answer: She had a strong advantage throughout the competition and eventually won the championship. Explanation: This idiom is a combination of two Chinese characters. The first character, 稳, means ""stable"" or ""stable."" The second character, 操, means ""to hold"" or ""to grasp."" The third character, 胜, means ""to win"" or ""to conquer."" The fourth character, 券, means ""ticket"" or ""coupon."" Therefore, the literal translation is ""Hold steady win ticket."" This idiom is used to describe a situation where someone has a strong advantage or a winning situation, and they can afford to be steady and not take unnecessary risks. Example: ""With a strong lead in the polls, the incumbent politician felt that he had a stable advantage and could afford to take a break during the campaign."" In this example, the politician has a ""stable advantage"" or a ""steady win ticket,"" and he can relax and not worry about losing the election. Note: This idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""ticket"" represents a winning situation or a strong advantage, rather than a literal ticket. Source: This idiom is from the Chinese language, and it is not a direct translation of an English idiom. However, it conveys a similar meaning to the English idiom ""having a winning hand."" Usage: This idiom is often used in formal or written language, such as in news articles, essays, or speeches. It is not commonly used in informal conversation. Variations: There are no common variations of this idiom. However, it can be used in different contexts to convey different meanings. For example, it can be used to describe a person's strong advantage in a business deal or a sports competition. Synonyms: Some synonyms for this idiom include ""having a strong advantage,"" ""having a winning hand,"" and ""being in a strong position."" Antonyms: Some antonyms for this idiom include ""being in a weak position,"" ""having a losing hand,"" and ""being at a disadvantage."" Related Idioms: Some related idioms include ""稳如泰山"" (stable as a mountain), ""稳如磐石"" (stable as a rock), and ""稳如老树"" (stable as an old tree). These idioms all convey a sense of stability and steadiness. Note: This idiom is not commonly used in everyday conversation,"

突飞猛进,Make a spurt of progress,Advance by leaps and bounds,"Rapidly take great strides Answer: Rapidly take great strides Explanation: 突飞猛进 is an idiom that means to make rapid progress or to advance quickly. The phrase is composed of two parts: 突飞 and 猛进. 突飞 is a verb that means to take off or to soar, while 猛进 is an adverb that means to make great strides or to advance rapidly. Together, the phrase describes a situation where someone or something is making rapid progress or advancing quickly. In a word-by-word translation, 突飞 can be translated to ""rapidly take off"" and 猛进 can be translated to ""great strides"", so the full translation is ""rapidly take great strides"". This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone or something is making rapid progress or achieving great success.  Example: ""After years of hard work, the company has made 突飞猛进 and is now a leading player in the industry."" (Translation: ""After years of hard work, the company has made rapid progress and is now a leading player in the industry."")  Another example: ""The student's 突飞猛进 in math has impressed the teacher."" (Translation: ""The student's rapid progress in math has impressed the teacher."")  In both examples, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone or something is making rapid progress or achieving great success.  Note: The idiom 突飞猛进 is often used in a positive context to describe progress or success, but it can also be used in a negative context to describe rapid decline or failure.

Overall, the idiom is a reminder that actions speak louder than words, and that one should be careful not to be deceived by empty promises or flattery.

贪小失大,Covet a little and lose a lot,Greedy for the small,"Greedy small lose big.  Explanation: This idiom means to prioritize small gains over big risks or opportunities. It is often used to caution against being overly cautious or risk-averse, as it can lead to missing out on greater rewards.

In this context, the farmer's greed for small stones led to him losing the chance to collect a much greater reward.

赴汤蹈火,Go through hell,Go through fire and water,"Go to boil soak through fire.

This idiom means to take a great risk or to go to great lengths to achieve something.  Example: ""She was willing to 赴汤蹈火 to get the job she wanted.""  (She was willing to go to great lengths to get the job she wanted.)  Source:  http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/chinese-idioms.htm  (Chinese Idioms)  Note:  The Chinese idiom is often translated as ""to brave the flames"" or ""to brave the waves"", but the literal translation is more accurate and more evocative of the original meaning.  The translation ""to brave the flames"" loses the sense of ""going to the trouble of boiling"" and ""stepping into fire"", which are the key components of the idiom.  The translation ""to brave the waves"" loses the sense of ""fire"" altogether, which is a key part of the idiom.  The literal translation ""go to boil soak through fire"" is more accurate and more evocative of the original meaning.  This is an example of how a literal translation can be more accurate and more evocative of the original meaning than a more idiomatic translation.  This is because a literal translation is more faithful to the original components of the idiom, and does not lose any of the key parts of the idiom in the process of translation.  In contrast, a more idiomatic translation may lose some of the key parts of the idiom in the process of translation, and may not be as accurate or as evocative of the original meaning.  Therefore, a literal translation is often the best choice when translating Chinese idioms.
