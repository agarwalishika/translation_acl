无以复加,In the extreme,Can't be added,"The idiom ""无以复加"" is a play on words that uses the structure of a question to create a phrase that means ""there is no way to add more.""

煮鹤焚琴,Inappreciative of art or beauty,Boil the Crane and Burn the Qin,"Literal: Translation: _______  Answer: Boil crane burn zither  Explanation: This idiom means to destroy something valuable in a fit of rage or passion. In the Tang Dynasty, a zither was a highly valued musical instrument, and a crane was a symbol of longevity and good fortune. The idiom is derived from a story about a man who, in a fit of anger, boiled his zither and burned his crane. The destruction of these valuable items represents the destruction of something precious due to one's own emotions.  The idiom is often used to describe situations where someone's emotions get the better of them, leading to negative consequences.  For example: ""He boiled his zither and burned his crane when he found out his girlfriend was cheating on him.""  In this example, the man's anger and hurt led him to destroy something valuable, much like the man in the story.  The idiom is often used to caution against letting emotions get the better of us, and to encourage self-control and rational thinking.  It is a reminder that our emotions can have a significant impact on our actions, and that we should strive to manage them in a healthy and constructive way.  The idiom is also used to describe situations where someone's emotions are so strong that they are unable to think clearly or make rational decisions.  For example: ""She boiled her zither and burned her crane when she found out her husband was having an affair.""  In this example, the woman's anger and hurt led her to make impulsive and destructive decisions, rather than taking a more thoughtful and rational approach.  The idiom is often used to encourage people to take a step back, calm down, and think clearly before acting on their emotions.  It is a reminder that our emotions can be powerful, but they should not control us.  Instead, we should strive to be in control of our emotions, and to make decisions that are thoughtful and rational.  The idiom is also used to describe situations where someone's emotions are so strong that they are unable to see the consequences of their actions.  For example: ""He boiled his zither and burned his crane when he decided to quit his job without a plan.""  In this example, the man's anger and frustration led him to make a rash decision, without considering the potential consequences.  The idiom is often used to caution against acting impulsively, and to encourage people to think carefully before making important decisions.  It is a reminder that our"

In this context, the idiom suggests that someone is taking actions that will lead to a bigger issue or problem.

The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation where someone is trying to be loud and important, but ultimately failing.

Example sentences:  - She's been working with him for years, so she's really gotten to know him, she's even entered his courtyard and entered his room.  - The journalist managed to enter the courtyard and enter the room of the company's CEO, gaining access to confidential information about the company's financial struggles.  - I don't want to enter the courtyard and enter the room of my neighbor's personal life, it's none of my business.  Note: This idiom is often used in a more formal or professional setting, such as in business or journalism, where gaining access to confidential information is a key part of the job.  In more casual settings, it may be used to describe a close friendship or a deep understanding of someone's personality.  The idiom is not typically used in a negative context, but it can imply a sense of invasion or intrusion if used in a way that suggests someone is prying into someone else's private life.  It's worth noting that the idiom is often used in a more figurative sense, where the ""courtyard"" and ""room"" represent the inner workings of a person's mind or a company's inner circle.  In this sense, the idiom is not necessarily about physical space, but rather about gaining access to a person's thoughts, feelings, and motivations.  Example:  - The psychologist was able to enter the courtyard and enter the room of her patient's subconscious mind, helping her to overcome her deep-seated fears.  - The CEO was able to enter the courtyard and enter the room of the company's board of directors, gaining a deeper understanding of their decision-making process.  - The detective was able to enter the courtyard and enter the room of the suspect's alibi, revealing a crucial piece of evidence that cracked the case.  In each of these examples, the idiom is used to describe a situation where someone gains access to confidential"

百端待举,A thousand things wait to be done,Waiting for everything,"A hundred hands waiting to lift [something] Answer: Waiting for the right moment to act. Explanation: This idiom refers to a situation where someone is waiting for the perfect moment to take action or make a move. It is often used to describe a state of patience and strategic thinking. In the idiom, ""百端"" literally means ""a hundred hands"" and ""待举"" means ""waiting to lift"". The phrase suggests that many people are eager to take action, but are waiting for the right moment to do so.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi (Translated by James Legge)  Note: The idiom is often used in a context where someone is waiting for a specific moment or opportunity to make a move, rather than acting impulsively. For example, a businessperson might wait for the right moment to make a deal, or a politician might wait for the right moment to make a statement. The idiom is often used to convey a sense of patience and strategic thinking.  Example sentences:  - ""He has been waiting for the right moment to make a move, waiting for the opportunity to come."" (他一直在等待着百端待举的机会，等待着时机的到来。)  - ""The company is waiting for the right moment to launch its new product, hoping to make a big impact."" (公司正在等待着百端待举的机会，希望能够造成重大影响。)  In both examples, the idiom ""百端待举"" is used to describe a situation where someone is waiting for the right moment to take action, and the tone is positive, implying that the person is being patient and strategic.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi (Translated by James Legge)  Note: The idiom ""百端待举"" is often used in combination with other idioms to convey a more nuanced meaning. For example, ""百端待举，日月如梭"" means ""a hundred hands waiting to lift, with days and months passing like arrows"". This phrase suggests that time is passing quickly, and people are waiting for the right moment to take action, but it is slipping away.  Source: Chinese Idioms and Proverbs by Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi (Translated by James Legge)  Note: The idiom ""百端待举"" is often used in literature and everyday conversation to describe"

Example sentence: ""He's been acting on his own, doing whatever he wants, without considering anyone else's opinions.""

Together, the idiom conveys the idea of acting independently and making decisions without external influence. In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe someone who is stubborn or obstinate, refusing to listen to others and insisting on doing things their own way.
