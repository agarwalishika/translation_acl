Example sentence: 他为了帮助同事,放弃了升职机会,这就是灭此朝食,无以报国。 (He sacrificed his own career advancement for the sake of his colleagues, which is a classic example of sacrificing one's own interests for the greater good.) Note: The idiom is a play on words, using ""朝食"" (morning meal) to refer to one's own interests or well-being, and ""报国"" (repay the country) to refer to serving the greater good. The phrase is often used to convey the idea that one's personal interests are secondary to the needs of others or the community. This idiom is often used in a context where someone is making a selfless sacrifice, such as giving up a promotion or a lucrative opportunity to help others. It's a way of acknowledging that their actions are motivated by a desire to benefit others, rather than personal gain. In modern usage, the idiom can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in business, politics, or social activism, to describe someone who is willing to put the needs of others before their own. For example, a company might use this idiom to describe an employee who sacrifices their own interests for the benefit of the company, or a politician might use it to describe a policy that prioritizes the needs of the community over personal interests. Overall, the idiom ""灭此朝食,无以报国"" is a powerful expression of the importance of selflessness and putting the needs of others before one's own. It encourages people to think beyond their own interests and consider the greater good. In a broader sense, the idiom can be seen as a reflection of the Confucian values of ren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness), which emphasize the importance of putting the needs of others before one's own and acting with moral integrity. In conclusion, the idiom ""灭此朝食,无以报国"" is a rich and complex expression that conveys a deep sense of moral obligation and responsibility to serve the greater good. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of selflessness and putting the needs of others"

火上加油,Add fuel to the flames (or fire),Pour oil on the flame,"He added oil to the fire. Answer: He made things worse. Explanation: This idiom means to make a bad situation worse. It is often used to describe a person who is trying to help someone in a difficult situation, but their actions are actually causing more harm. For example, ""He kept giving her advice, but it was like adding oil to a fire, making things worse."" The idiom is thought to have originated from the practice of adding oil to a fire to make it burn more intensely. In this context, adding oil to a fire would be counterproductive, as it would only make the fire burn more fiercely and potentially out of control. Similarly, in the context of the idiom, adding oil to a fire represents taking actions that exacerbate a bad situation, rather than helping to resolve it. The idiom is often used to caution people against interfering in situations where they may not fully understand the complexities or consequences of their actions. It can also be used to describe a person who is being overly helpful or well-intentioned, but ultimately causing more harm than good. In some cases, the idiom may also be used to describe a situation where someone is trying to ""fix"" a problem, but their attempts are actually making it worse. For example, ""The company's attempts to cut costs by reducing staff only added oil to the fire, leading to a decline in productivity and morale."" Overall, the idiom ""火上加油"" is a reminder that sometimes, the best thing to do in a difficult situation is to step back and let things unfold naturally, rather than trying to ""fix"" them with well-intentioned but misguided actions. In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom has also been used in a more figurative sense to describe situations where people are trying to ""add fuel to the fire"" or make a bad situation worse. For example, ""The politician's inflammatory rhetoric only added oil to the fire, exacerbating the tensions between the two groups."" In this sense, the idiom is often used to caution people against using language or actions that may be perceived as inflammatory or provocative, as they can have unintended consequences and make a bad situation worse. In conclusion, the idiom ""火上加油"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of being mindful of our actions and words, and avoiding well-intentioned but misguided attempts to ""fix"" problems. By understanding the origins and nuances of this idiom, we can better navigate complex situations and avoid causing more harm than good"

Source:  https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2018-04/20/content_36351123.htm  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone's words or actions lead to a violent or destructive outcome, but the speaker themselves may not have directly caused the violence.  In this example sentence, the speaker is implying that the provocative speech was the catalyst for the violent protests, but they are not directly responsible for the violence.

It is worth noting that this idiom can have a negative connotation, implying that the speaker is criticizing or condemning the person who made the provocative speech or took the provocative action.  However, it can also be used in a more neutral or objective sense, simply to describe a situation where someone's words or actions led to a violent or destructive outcome.  In this case, the speaker is not necessarily taking a moral stance, but rather simply observing the consequences of the provocative speech or action.  Overall, this idiom is a useful way to describe a situation where someone's words or actions have unintended and potentially harmful consequences.  It is a common idiom in Chinese, and is often used in a variety of contexts to convey a sense of regret, warning, or observation.  It is worth noting that this idiom is not limited to violent or destructive outcomes, but can also be used to describe situations where someone's words or actions lead to other negative consequences, such as social unrest or economic instability.  In this case, the speaker is not necessarily implying that the person who made the provocative speech or took the provocative action was wrong or malicious, but rather simply observing the consequences of their actions.  This idiom is a useful tool for describing complex social and political situations.  Answer: The provocative speech incited violent protests.

熟视无睹,Ignore,Turn a blind eye,"Familiar sight, no seeing.  Explanation: The idiom ""熟视无睹"" is a combination of two Chinese characters: ""熟"" (shú) meaning ""familiar"" or ""well-known"", ""视"" (shì) meaning ""sight"" or ""see"", and ""无"" (wú) meaning ""no"" or ""not"", and ""睹"" (dǔ) meaning ""see"" or ""perceive"". The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is so familiar with something that they no longer pay attention to it, or they are so used to it that they don't even notice it anymore. In this sense, the idiom is suggesting that familiarity can lead to a kind of blindness or lack of awareness.  In the translation, ""Familiar sight"" is a direct translation of the first two characters, ""熟视"", and ""no seeing"" is a direct translation of the last two characters, ""无睹"".  The two parts are combined to form the complete idiom ""熟视无睹"".  The translation is meant to be a literal, word-by-word translation, without any commentary or interpretation.  It is intended to convey the exact meaning of the idiom in a concise and accurate way.  The translation is not meant to be a natural-sounding English sentence, but rather a direct representation of the Chinese characters.  The goal is to provide a clear and accurate understanding of the idiom, rather than to create a fluent or idiomatic English expression.  Therefore, the translation ""Familiar sight, no seeing"" is a faithful representation of the Chinese idiom ""熟视无睹"".  This translation approach is often referred to as a ""word-for-word"" or ""literal"" translation, as it seeks to convey the exact meaning of each individual character, without any attempt to rephrase or reword the text.  This approach can be useful for understanding the nuances and connotations of the original text, as well as for learning the meaning of individual characters and phrases.  However, it may not always result in a natural-sounding or idiomatic English expression, as seen in the translation ""Familiar sight, no seeing"".  Nevertheless, the literal translation approach can be a valuable tool for language learners and scholars seeking to understand the complexities of language and culture.  By examining the individual components of the idiom, we can gain a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical context in which it was used."

舞文弄墨,Indulge in fancy writing,Dance with ink,"to be a literary dandy.  Literal: (wǔ wén róng mò)  Explanation:  This idiom refers to writing or composing in a playful, creative, and artistic manner, often with a focus on beauty and elegance. It can also imply a sense of carefree abandon or a lack of concern for practicality or convention. The phrase is often used to describe a person who writes or composes with flair and imagination, but may not necessarily produce work that is technically proficient or well-structured.  In this sense, the idiom suggests that the writer or composer is more interested in the creative process itself than in the end result.  This can be seen as a positive trait, as it allows the individual to express themselves freely and authentically, but it can also be seen as a negative trait, as it may result in work that is lacking in substance or coherence.

In this sense, the idiom can be seen as a way of acknowledging and celebrating the individual's creativity and imagination, while also acknowledging the potential risks and limitations of their approach.

行百里者半九十,One must sustain one's effort when a task is nearing completion,Barry is only half of 90,"Literal: Translation: _______________________  Answer: One who travels a hundred li has already lost nine-tenths of his life.  Note: A ""li"" is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly equivalent to 1/3 of a mile.  This idiom is used to describe someone who has invested a lot of time and energy into a long and difficult journey or endeavor, and is now feeling exhausted and drained.  Example: ""After working on this project for years, I feel like I've lost nine-tenths of my life."" (meaning, I'm feeling really exhausted and drained from working on this project for so long.)  Another example: ""I've been studying for three years, and I feel like I've lost nine-tenths of my life."" (meaning, I'm feeling really tired and drained from studying for so long.)  This idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone has invested a lot of time and energy into something, but is now feeling the consequences of that investment.  It's a reminder that time and energy are finite resources, and that investing them in a long and difficult journey or endeavor can be costly.  The idiom is thought to have originated from the idea that when you travel a hundred li, you have already used up most of your energy and resources, and are now feeling the effects of that exhaustion.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is feeling overwhelmed or burnt out, but is still determined to reach their goal.  For example: ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed, but I'm not giving up yet."" (meaning, I'm still determined to reach my goal, even though I'm feeling exhausted and drained.)  Overall, the idiom ""行百里者半九十"" is a powerful reminder that time and energy are finite resources, and that investing them in a long and difficult journey or endeavor can be costly.  It's a phrase that is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, and is often used in everyday conversation to describe a situation where someone is feeling exhausted and drained.  The idiom is also often used in business and education settings to remind people that success requires hard work and dedication, and that it's never too late to keep pushing forward.  In these settings, the idiom is often used to encourage people to take a break and recharge, rather than burning out from overwork.  For example:"
行同狗彘,Make a beast of oneself,Go with the dog,1. What is the literal meaning of the Chinese characters in the idiom?
行成于思,Success depends on forethought,Act by thinking,"Success is the result of careful planning and perseverance.  Explanation: 行 (xíng) means ""to do"" or ""to act."" 成 (chéng) means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve."" 于 (yú) is a preposition indicating ""result"" or ""outcome."" 思 (sī) means ""thought"" or ""thinking.""  Therefore, 行成于思 translates to ""Success is the result of careful planning and perseverance."" This idiom emphasizes the importance of careful thinking, thorough consideration, and unwavering determination in achieving success.  It suggests that success is not accidental, but rather the culmination of a deliberate and persistent effort.  For example: ""为了实现目标，他每天都在思考和计划，最后终于实现了成功。"" (He thought and planned every day, and finally achieved success.)  or ""通过努力和坚持，她终于实现了自己的梦想。"" (Through hard work and perseverance, she finally achieved her dream.)  This idiom is often used to encourage people to be more diligent and persistent in their pursuit of goals.  It implies that success is not solely dependent on talent or luck, but rather on the individual's hard work and determination.  In modern usage, the idiom is often used to describe the process of achieving success through careful planning and perseverance.  For example: ""通过市场调研和产品开发，她的公司最终实现了成功。"" (Through market research and product development, her company finally achieved success.)  or ""通过不断的学习和实践，她终于成为了一名优秀的演讲者。"" (Through continuous learning and practice, she finally became an excellent public speaker.)  Overall, 行成于思 is a valuable idiom that reminds us that success is not a one-time event, but rather a process that requires continuous effort and dedication.  By incorporating this idiom into our daily conversations, we can promote a culture of intentional living and achievement.  As the ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu, once said, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" (千里之行，始于足下。)  This idiom is a reminder that even the smallest actions and decisions can have a profound impact on our lives and the world around us.  By embracing 行成于思, we can cultivate a mindset of intentional living and achieve our goals through careful planning and reflection.  So, the next time you're faced with a decision or"

阳奉阴违,Comply in public but oppose in private,Yang follows yin,"Obey the sun, oppose the moon Answer: Obey the sun, oppose the moon Explanation: The idiom 阳奉阴违 literally means ""obey the sun, oppose the moon"". It refers to a situation where someone outwardly shows loyalty and obedience to a superior or a higher authority (the ""sun""), but secretly opposes or disobeys them (the ""moon""). This idiom is often used to describe someone who is insincere or hypocritical in their words and actions. The ""sun"" and ""moon"" are used to represent the opposing forces of light and darkness, symbolizing the contrast between appearance and reality. In this context, the idiom suggests that the person is trying to present a false image of loyalty and obedience, while secretly harboring opposing views or intentions. Example sentence: 他总是阳奉阴违，表面上听从领导的命令，但实际上却在背后议论。 (He always obeys the sun and opposes the moon, outwardly following the leader's orders, but secretly criticizing them behind their back.) In this example, the idiom is used to describe someone who appears to be loyal and obedient, but is actually insincere and disloyal. The use of the idiom highlights the contrast between the person's words and actions, and suggests that they are not to be trusted. The idiom 阳奉阴违 is often used in a negative context to describe someone who is insincere or hypocritical. It is not typically used in a positive context to describe someone who is genuinely loyal and obedient. In Chinese culture, the sun and moon are often used as symbols to represent opposing forces or contrasting ideas. The sun represents light, warmth, and life, while the moon represents darkness, coldness, and death. In the context of the idiom, the sun and moon are used to represent the opposing forces of appearance and reality, or loyalty and disloyalty. The idiom 阳奉阴违 is often used in everyday language to describe someone who is insincere or hypocritical. It is a common expression used to convey a sense of distrust or suspicion towards someone who appears to be loyal and obedient, but is actually not. In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom 阳奉阴违 can also be used figuratively to describe a situation where someone is trying to present a false image or hide their true intentions. For example, a politician might use the idiom to describe a situation where they are pretending to support"

食而不化,Eat without digesting - read without understanding,Eat without melting,"He's just eating but not digesting. Answer: He's just eating but not digesting. Explanation: This idiom describes someone who consumes knowledge or information but fails to apply it or put it into practice. It suggests that the person is merely superficially familiar with the subject matter but lacks the ability to integrate it into their daily life or decision-making processes. The idiom is often used to criticize individuals who are more interested in accumulating knowledge for its own sake rather than using it to improve their skills or achieve their goals. Example: ""He's always reading books on management, but his company is still struggling. He's just eating but not digesting."" In this example, the speaker is suggesting that the person is consuming knowledge, but not applying it in a meaningful way. This idiom can also be used to describe someone who is merely going through the motions of learning or studying, but not truly engaging with the material or making an effort to understand it. Synonyms: superficial, shallow, lacking depth. Antonyms: absorb, understand, apply. Related Idioms: eat one's words, learn by heart, learn from experience.
