जुबान काट लेना,to regret words spoken,to bite the tongue,"Bite one's tongue. Bite one's tongue is the closest English translation to the idiom जुबान काट लेना (Jubān kāṭ lenā). The idiom is used to describe the act of suppressing or withholding one's words or opinions, often due to fear of repercussions or social consequences. This is similar to the English idiom ""bite one's tongue,"" which means to refrain from speaking one's mind or expressing one's thoughts, often due to self-control or restraint. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the idiom. To speak out of turn and to speak one's mind are the opposite of the idiom, as they involve expressing oneself freely. To be tongue-tied refers to a person's inability to speak fluently or articulately, which is not related to the idiom. To cut one's tongue out is a literal and violent interpretation of the idiom, which is not the intended meaning."
