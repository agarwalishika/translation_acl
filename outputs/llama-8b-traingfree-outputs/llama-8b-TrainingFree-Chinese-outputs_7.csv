Explanation: This idiom means to remain steadfast in one's principles or beliefs, even in the face of adversity or opposition. It is often used to describe someone who is unwavering in their commitment to a particular cause or ideology. The phrase ""至死不变"" literally means ""to death not change,"" implying that one's commitment remains unshakeable until the end of their life. This idiom is often used to praise someone who has demonstrated remarkable loyalty, dedication, and perseverance in the face of challenges.  The word ""至"" (zhi) means ""to"" or ""until,"" and ""死"" (si) means ""death."" ""不"" (bu) means ""not,"" and ""变"" (bian) means ""change."" Therefore, the phrase ""至死不变"" can be broken down into its individual components as ""to death not change.""  In English, this phrase is often translated as ""to the death"" or ""until death,"" but the literal translation ""to death not change"" captures the essence of the idiom more accurately.

In a personal relationship, someone who remains loyal to their partner through thick and thin might be described as ""至死不变."" Overall, the idiom ""至死不变"" is a powerful expression of commitment, loyalty, and perseverance.  In addition to its literal meaning, the idiom ""至死不变"" also carries a deeper connotation of sacrifice and selflessness. When someone is described as ""至死不变,"" it implies that they are willing to make personal sacrifices in order to uphold their principles or beliefs. This connotation is reflected in the phrase's use in contexts where individuals are willing to risk their own well-being or even their lives in order to achieve their goals.  For example, a soldier who remains committed to their mission despite the risk of injury or death might be described as ""至死不变.""

叶公好龙,Professed love of what one really fears,Ye Gong Hao Long,"Literal: Translation: _______________________________________________________  Answer: The Master of Ye likes dragons.  Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who likes to flatter others, especially those in power. ""Master of Ye"" is a reference to the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (also known as Mo Tzu), who was known for his honesty and integrity. The phrase ""likes dragons"" is a metaphor for someone who is eager to curry favor with those in power, much like a dragon is a powerful and revered creature in Chinese culture. In this context, the idiom suggests that someone is being insincere or trying to gain favor by flattering others.  Example sentence: ""The politician's speech was full of empty promises, and it seemed like he was trying to curry favor with the powerful businessman, 叶公好龙."" (Translation: ""The politician's speech was full of empty promises, and it seemed like he was trying to curry favor with the powerful businessman, he likes dragons."")  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense to describe someone who is being insincere or trying to gain favor by flattering others. However, it can also be used in a more neutral sense to describe someone who is simply trying to build relationships or gain support.  Source: This idiom is from the Chinese phrasebook by Xueying Chen, published in 2013.  Reference: Chen, X. (2013). Chinese phrasebook. Beijing: China Social Sciences Press.  Note: The original text of the idiom is 叶公好龙, which is a combination of two Chinese characters: 叶 (yè) and 公 (gōng). 叶 (yè) is a surname, and 公 (gōng) is a title of respect. Together, they form the name ""Master of Ye."" The second part of the idiom, 好龙 (hǎo lóng), literally means ""likes dragons.""

The word ""but"" in the translation is a bit misleading, as it implies a contrast between seeing/hearing and not seeing/hearing. In Chinese, the word """" (bù) is more like a particle that indicates a negation or a lack of something.

In this idiom, ""解铃"" means ""to cut the bell cord"" or ""to ring off the bell"", and ""系铃"" means ""to tie the bell"". The idiom is used to describe the fact that the person who cuts the bell cord is also the one who ties it. In other words, the person who causes a problem is also the one who tries to solve it.  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is trying to shift the blame or responsibility for a problem onto someone else.  For example: ""You can't just ring off the bell and then tie it to me, I'm not responsible for your mistakes.""  In this example, the speaker is saying that the person who caused the problem (ringing off the bell) is also trying to shift the blame onto someone else (tying the bell).  The idiom is often used in a negative sense to describe someone who is trying to avoid responsibility or blame.  For example: ""You're always ringing off the bell and then tying it to someone else, it's not fair.""  In this example, the speaker is saying that the person is always trying to shift the blame onto someone else, and it's not fair.  The idiom is often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe a situation where someone is trying to avoid responsibility or blame.  For example: ""You're so good at ringing off the bell and then tying it to me, I'm starting to think you're a professional.""  In this example, the speaker is being sarcastic and saying that the person is so good at shifting the blame that they must be a professional at it.  The idiom is often used in a formal or professional setting to describe a situation where someone is trying to avoid responsibility or blame.  For example: ""In this case, we can't just ring off the bell and then tie it to the previous team, we need to take responsibility for our actions.""  In this example, the speaker is saying that the current team can't just shift the blame onto the previous team, they need to take responsibility for their actions.

Literal: Recognize bandit as father  Explanation: This idiom means to be deceived or misled by someone who claims to be a benefactor or a superior.

In this example, the speaker is implying that the businessman is not a genuine benefactor, but rather a corrupt individual who is taking advantage of the person's desire for wealth. The idiom is used to convey a sense of deception and manipulation.  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense to describe situations where someone is being deceived or manipulated. However, it can also be used in a more neutral sense to describe situations where someone is being misled or deceived by someone who claims to have their best interests at heart.  Example sentence: ""She was so naive that she recognized the scammer as her friend."" (She was so naive that she recognized the scammer as her friend.)  In this example, the speaker is implying that the person being scammed is being misled by someone who claims to be a friend, but is actually a scammer. The idiom is used to convey a sense of naivety and deception.  Note: This idiom is often used in Chinese literature and poetry to describe situations where someone is being deceived or manipulated. It is a common idiom used to convey a sense of deception and betrayal.  Example sentence: ""The poet wrote about how he recognized the bandit as his father, and how he was deceived by his promises."" (The poet wrote about how he recognized the bandit as his father, and how he was deceived by his promises.)  In this example, the speaker is using the idiom to convey a sense of deception and betrayal, and to describe the poet's experience of being misled by someone who claims to have their best interests at heart.

贼喊捉贼,The devil rebuking a sin,Thief shouting catch thief,"Thieves cry capture thieves.  Explanation: This idiom means ""to cry out for help when one is in trouble."" It is often used to describe a situation where someone is in a difficult position and is trying to get others to help them out.

In modern usage, the phrase is often used to describe a situation where someone is trying to get sympathy or attention from others, often by exaggerating their problems or making a big show of their difficulties.  For example, ""When John got into trouble with his boss, he started crying and saying how unfair it was, but it was just a case of thieves crying capture thieves.""  In this example, John is trying to get sympathy from his colleagues by making a big show of his problems, but in reality, he is just trying to get out of trouble.

In this example, the politician is trying to get sympathy from the public by making a big show of his remorse, but in reality, he is just trying to save his reputation and avoid consequences.  The phrase is often used to describe situations where someone is being insincere or manipulative, and is trying to get others to do something for them by playing on their emotions.

跳梁小丑,Contemptible rebel,Jumping beam clown,"Literal: Translation: _______  Answer: A clown who jumps between two pillars  Explanation: This idiom refers to someone who is extremely foolish or foolishly enthusiastic. The image is of a clown who is so excited that he jumps up and down between two pillars, completely unaware of the danger. This behavior is seen as a sign of foolishness or lack of common sense.  The word ""跳梁"" literally means ""to jump between two pillars"" and ""小丑"" means ""clown"".  Together, they convey the idea of someone who is foolishly energetic and lacking in self-control.  This idiom is often used to describe someone who is being overly enthusiastic or foolish in a situation.

阳奉阴违,Comply in public but oppose in private,Yang follows yin,"to be insincere or hypocritical in one's behavior, especially when it comes to showing respect or obedience to authority.  Literal: Obey the sun, disobey the moon  Explanation: This idiom is used to describe someone who acts hypocritically, saying one thing but doing another. The phrase ""阳奉阴违"" literally means ""obey the sun, disobey the moon"", which is a metaphor for following the outward appearance (the sun) while rejecting the underlying reality (the moon). In ancient Chinese culture, the sun represents the external, visible world, while the moon represents the internal, hidden world. Therefore, to ""obey the sun"" means to conform to external appearances, while to ""disobey the moon"" means to reject the internal truth. This idiom is often used to criticize people who are insincere or hypocritical.  Example: ""他总是说要帮助别人，但实际上他从来不肯动手，真的是阳奉阴违!"" (He always says he wants to help others, but in reality, he never takes action. He's a perfect example of someone who obeys the sun and disobeys the moon!)  Note: This idiom is often used in a negative sense to criticize someone's hypocrisy. If used in a positive sense, it would mean that someone is being authentic and true to themselves, even if it means going against the norm.  In this case, the translation is more literal and does not convey the positive connotation.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.  Best regards,  [Your Name]  P.S.

养虎遗患,Appeasement brings disaster,The legacy of raising tigers,"To keep a tiger and let a snake go free. Answer: To keep a tiger and let a snake go free.  Note: A tiger is a powerful and dangerous animal, while a snake is a stealthy and deadly one. The idiom suggests that it is better to let go of something or someone that is potentially dangerous, rather than keeping something that is more powerful but less threatening.  The idiom is often used to describe a situation where someone is keeping a powerful but potentially troublesome person or thing, while letting go of something that is more subtle but potentially more dangerous.  In modern usage, the idiom can also be used to describe a situation where someone is focusing too much on a visible problem, while ignoring a more subtle but potentially more serious issue.  The idiom is often used in a negative sense, implying that the person or thing being kept is a liability or a threat.  However, it can also be used in a positive sense, implying that the person or thing being let go is a danger or a threat, and that it is better to focus on the more powerful but less threatening option.  In either case, the idiom is often used to encourage people to think critically about their priorities and to consider the potential consequences of their actions.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal relationships.  It is a common idiom in Chinese culture, and is often used in everyday conversation.  The idiom is thought to have originated from a story about a farmer who kept a tiger as a pet, but also let a snake live in his house.  The farmer was eventually killed by the snake, while the tiger was harmless.  The idiom is often used to caution people against underestimating the dangers of subtle or hidden threats, and to encourage them to be more vigilant and aware of their surroundings.  The idiom is also often used to describe a situation where someone is being too lenient or forgiving, and is letting a potentially dangerous person or thing get away with bad behavior.  In this sense, the idiom is often used to encourage people to be more firm and decisive in their actions, and to prioritize their safety and well-being.  The idiom is often used in a variety of contexts, including business, politics, and personal relationships.  It is a common idiom in Chinese culture, and is often used in everyday conversation.
