गागर में सागर भरना,to say a lot in few words,to fill the ocean into a pitcher,"The ocean filling the Gagarin
It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the translation request. The phrase ""गागर में सागर भरना"" translates more accurately to ""The ocean filling the Gagarin,"" but this doesn't make much sense in English as it's not a common phrase or idiom.

If you meant to translate ""The ocean filling the Gagarin capsule,"" then it would be:
